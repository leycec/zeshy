# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Shebang Zeshy loader. This Zeshy-specific Zsh script replaces the
# "#!/usr/bin/env zsh" shebang command, used to invoke Zsh on a file, with the
# "#!/usr/bin/env zeshy" shebang command, used to invoke Zeshy-enabled Zsh on a
# file, where "Zeshy-enabled" means a Zsh shell process having available all
# functions, aliases, and variables defined by "zeshy/core". 
#
# --------------------( USAGE                              )--------------------
# Third-party scripts requiring one or more Zeshy components are encouraged to
# replace any existing shebang line at the top of each such file with:
#
#     #!/usr/bin/env zeshy
# 
# This invokes this script on each such file, which:
#
# * Sources "zeshy/core", the core Zeshy module providing (among other base
#   functionality) the import() function with which third-party scripts may
#   optionally import all other Zeshy modules in a platform portable manner.
# * Runs "zsh" on the passed file.
#
# Third-party scripts requiring one or more Zeshy components but not declaring
# the above shebang line *must* manually source "zeshy/core" at the top of each
# such file with:
#
#     #!/usr/bin/env zsh
#     
# Note that this script performs additional checks for path and platform sanity;
# thus, the above approach is strongly discouraged.

# ....................{ ZESHY                              }....................
# Ensure "${ZESHY_HOME}" is defined and, if not, attempt to find it.
