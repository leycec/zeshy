---------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )---------------------
Zeshy is a high-level Zsh framework packaging commonly useful aliases,
functions, and variables into first-class components reusable for both
interactive command-line sessions and programmatic third-party scripts.

Zsh is arguably the most feature-rich of platform-portable, dynamically-typed,
interpreted shell scripting languages. Unfortunately, such richness comes at a
profound cost: legibility. Zsh trades conciseness for legibility of syntax,
permitting such infamously unreadable one-liners as:

    # List all subdirectories with at least two files prefixed by "index.".
    ls **/*(D/e:'l=($REPLY/index.*(N)); (( $#l >= 2 ))':)

Zeshy renders Zsh accessible to lay users by wrapping inscrutable syntactic
shell sugar with simplistic interfaces leveraging only common programming
language idioms and syntax. Inspired by such industry-standard scripting
languages as Python and Ruby, Zeshy hopes to demonstrate Zsh's broad
applicability, extensibility, and usability.

Zsh is more than merely impressive syntactic antics and flamboyantly obfuscatory
jargon. Zsh is command-line expressivity. Zsh is shell-scripting explosivity. 
Zsh is blossoming into the mainstream. Join us, and Zeshy, as we zest this
stream of software use with zestiness!

---------------------( DEPENDENCIES                       )---------------------
Zeshy depends only on Zsh -- but dynamically detects and supports a variety of
popular applications (e.g., git, rsync, screen, tex) and distributions (e.g.,
Gentoo) with runtime components.

---------------------( LICENSE                            )---------------------
Zeshy adheres to the customary GPLv3 license. See LICENSE for details.
