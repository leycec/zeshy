---------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )---------------------
Zeshy is a high-level Zsh framework. It standardizes high-level Zsh functions,
aliases, and variables into components for use from third-party Zsh
applications, homebrew Zsh scripts, and interactive Zsh shells.

Zeshy provides dynamic facilities typically associated with more popular
platform portable, dynamically typed, interpreted scripting languages (Perl,
Python, Ruby, et al.). Ideally, Zeshy reflects the emerging ecologies of:

* Applicability. Zsh *is* applicable to a mainstream audience.
* Extensibility. Zsh *is* extensible in a standardized fashion.
* Usability. Zsh *is* usable for practical, professional, and industrial needs.

Zsh is blossoming into the mainstream. Join us, and Zeshy, as we zest this
stream of software use with zestiness!

---------------------( DEPENDENCIES                       )---------------------
Zeshy depends only on Zsh. Zeshy is designed, however, to take advantage of
these dependencies if optionally available at runtime:

* ImageMagick.

Zeshy is also designed to take advantage of distribution-specific functionality,
including:

* Exherbo.
* Gentoo.
