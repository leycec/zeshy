[stderr: string, status: integer] view_pipe_progress()

Visualize the progress of the current pipeline with a progress bar with the
currently configured `pv`-specific options (e.g., ${ZY_OPTIONS_PV}) to
standard error, to avoid conflict with standard output both connecting pipeline
commands and printed by `ncurses`-based commands. Assuming default options, such
progress includes such pipeline's total elapsed time and predicted remaining
time until termination.
