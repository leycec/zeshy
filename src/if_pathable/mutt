    #FUXME: This should be an abbreviation, obviously. Consequently, we'll need
    #an ${ZESHY_ALIAS_CLI_ABBREVIATIONS_IF_PATHABLE} -- or we would if I still
    #considered this a fine idea. Clearly, it's not. This is the only such alias
    #declared here or anywhere! Just shift this into a new configuration file
    #"if_pathable/vim/if_config/pathable/vim" and remove this global. Done.
    #FUXME: Incidentally, all "if_config/if_pathable/" subdirectories should be
    #renamed to "if_config/pathable/". They're *NOT* conditional.

#FUXME: Actually, this is probably not terribly helpful given sidebar
#functionality.
