# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy Mercurial, implementing "hg"-specific functionality.
#
# --------------------( COMMANDS ~ risky                   )--------------------
# Additional commands, for which this script provides no aliases or functions
# due to innate riskiness, include:
#
#     # Revert the repository to the remote master.

# string hg_list_deleted_files(void)
#
# List each deleted file in the current Mercurial repository on a separate line,
# formatted:
#
#     "${deleted_filename}" deleted in revision ${revision_integer}.
#
# This function is heavily inspired by a related Stackoverflow thread, with
# thanks to dfa and Peter Rowell:
hg_list_deleted_files() {
    die_if_args
    hg log --template '\"{file_dels}\" deleted in revision {rev}.\n' |
        grep -v '^\"\"'
}

# string hg_find_deleted_file(string grep_pattern)
#
# Find the deleted file in the current Mercurial repository whose filename
# corresponds to the passed grep pattern.
hg_find_deleted_file() {
    die_unless_arg 'expected exactly one grep expression'

    string grep_pattern="${1}"
    say "finding deleted files matching \"${grep_pattern}\"..."
    hg_list_deleted_files | grep "${ZESHY_GREP_OPTIONS[@]}" "^${grep_pattern}"
}

# void hg_recover_deleted_file(int revision_integer, string filename)
#
# Recover the deleted file from the current Mercurial repository corresponding
# to the passed revision of the passed file.
#
# This function is intended to be called after manually calling the 
# hg_find_deleted_file() function (to find the most recent revision number
# having this file).
hg_recover_deleted_file() {
    die_unless_args_2 'expected exactly one revision number and one filename'

    integer revision_integer="${1}"
    string deleted_file="${2}"
    say "recovering ${deleted_file} from revision ${revision_integer}..."
    hg revert -r ${revision_integer} "${deleted_file}"
}

#FIXME: Obsolete.

#   die_if_args
