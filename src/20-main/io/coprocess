and output attached to temporary anonymous FIFOs readable and writable only by

void set_string_to_coprocess_output(string string_name)

Set the passed string variable to all standard output of the coprocess for the
current shell. If no such coprocess exists, throw an exception.

    # Validate sanity.
    die_unless_arg 'Expected one string name.'

    #FIXME: Hmm; actually, wouldn't the following work in a non-blocking
    #manner?
    #
    #    IFS= read -rp -t 0 -d '' "${1}"

    # Set such string. Ideally, the following (slightly more efficient)
    # assignment should also work:
    #
    #     IFS= read -rp -d "" "${1}"
    #
    # Instead, such assignment silently blocks.
