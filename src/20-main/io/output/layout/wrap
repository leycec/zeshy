1-based index in list ${match} of the next text substring to be wrapped by a
PCRE returned by set_string_to_pcre_wrapping_to_width(), guaranteed to have been
properly split on an inter-word delimiter (e.g., space, tab, newline) or
intra-word delimiter (e.g., hyphen). In either case, such substring is
guaranteed to be no longer than the maximum line length passed to such function
_and_ requires no suffixing hyphenation.

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STRING_WRAP_PCRE_INDEX_UNSPLIT=2 <<'/---'
1-based index in list ${match} of the next text substring to be wrapped by a
PCRE returned by set_string_to_pcre_wrapping_to_width(), guaranteed to _not_ have
been properly split on an inter-word delimiter (e.g., space, tab, newline) or
intra-word delimiter (e.g., hyphen). Such substring is guaranteed to be no
longer than the maximum line length passed to such function _but_ requires
suffixing hyphenation.

Ideally, most substrings to be wrapped are properly split and hence matched into
index ${ZESHY_STRING_WRAP_PCRE_INDEX_SPLIT} instead. However, when the shortest
splittable substring exceeds the width in characters of the current terminal,
such substring must be itself be broken into substrings smaller than such width.
This index captures such substrings.

Get the maximum number of characters in the body of each line of output (i.e.,
excluding width of visual borders on such lines) wrapped to the current terminal

slightly less than that returned by get_terminal_width().

#do, this is hardly a calamity. That said, an alternative algorithm minimizing
#the "raggedness" of the end of each line is *CLEARLY* a better approach, as
#LaTeX demonstrates. To that end, it would be helpful to implement a modern
#variant on Knuth's now-infamous "minimization of the square of the space at the
#end of all paragraph lines" algorithm. While the most common solutions are
#O(n^2), a number of novel linear-time soutions appear to exist. Furthermore,
#note this interesting addendum, http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Text::Reflow --
#"The reflow algorithm tries to keep the lines the same length but also tries to
#break at punctuation, and avoid breaking within a proper name or after certain
#connectives ("a", "the", etc.). The result is a file with a more "ragged" right
#margin than is produced by fmt or Text::Wrap but it is easier to read since
#fewer phrases are broken across line breaks." In any case, there's no want of
#great alternatives. Here are a few other continuations to the core Knuth

string set_string_to_pcre_wrapping_to_width(
    string string_name,
    integer line_width)

Set the passed string variable to a PCRE matching at most the passed number of
characters suffixed by either a hyphen, whitespace, or the string end. By
design, this PCRE is suitable for iteratively wrapping lines to such length in a
multiline-aware manner by calling for_string_text_matching_pcre:(), as implemented by
for_string_wrapped_to_width().

== Algorithmic Alternatives ==

Such PCRE efficiently implements the ``naive'' greedy algorithm for wrapping
lines in a word-aware manner, wrapping maximally many words per line and hence
minimizing the resulting number of lines. While efficient, such algorithm
commonly fails to produce a uniform ragged right edge and hence aesthetical
and/or legible output. Since this is no worse than modern word processors do,
such failings hardly constitute a calamity. Yet we can do better. (Indeed, the
prior example exhibits an extremely ragged right edge.)

Ideally, lines should be wrapped so as to minimize *right raggedness* (i.e., the
difference between the length of each line in a contiguous paragraph). The
canonical algorithm for doing so remains Donald Knuth's implementation of line
wrapping in [La]TeX, minimizing the square of the space at the end of all
paragraph lines. Such algorithm requires numerical computation and hence cannot
be implemented as a PCRE. For further details, see the corresponding
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_wrap[Wikipedia article].

    #   of which alternative matches):
    #   * "\n", matching but *NOT* capturing a blank line (i.e., line containing
    #     only a newline). Since this alternative captures no groups, all groups
    #     will be the empty string on matching a blank line.  While this
    #     probably sounds unhelpful, the simple implementation of
    #     for_string_wrapped_to_width() proves otherwise.
    #   * "(...)(?:...)", capturing a maximally long substring not exceeding the
    #     passed length to ${match[1]}, suffixed by an uncaptured and hence
    #     ignored delimiter consisting of either:
    #     * "\h+\n?", a maximally long run of horizontal whitespace followed by
    #       an ignorable newline.
    #     * "\n", a newline.
    #     * "\Z", either the string end or a newline followed by the string end.
    #   * "(...-)", capturing a maximally long hyphenated substring not
    #     exceeding the passed length minus one to ${match[1]}.
    #   * "()(...)", capturing a maximally long unhyphenated substring not
    #     exceeding the passed length minus one to ${match[2]}, suffixed by none
    #     of the above delimiters. This fallback condition handles such edge
    #     cases as contiguous runs of characters exceeding the length of a
    #     single line but containing no spaces, tabs, newlines, or hyphens,
    #     without which such characters would be silently ignored during PCRE
    #     iteration. Since the caller typically breaks such runs at the passed

    #     group matches one less character than the line length.

  between the text and right padder for each wrapped line, defaulting to a space.
* `${style_prefix}padder_right`, styling the substring repeatedly filling the
  space between the text and right border for each wrapped line, defaulting to a

#FUXME: I believe that wrapping is currently failing for long contiguous strings

#FUXME: A thought experiment succinctly identified the issue: ANSI escape
#sequences embedded in strings. We need to account for such sequences when
#wrapping strings, principally in the following two places:
#
#* set_string_to_pcre_wrapping_to_width(). The returned PCRE must ignore such
#  sequences. To do so, replace every instance of "." with
#  "(?:${ZESHY_ANSI_PCRE})?.", where ${ZESHY_ANSI_PCRE} is a newly defined
#  string global defined in @{ansi} based on corresponding glob patterns.
#* wrap_string_in_style(). Such function currently calculates
#  the length of the current line manually. We'll probably need to replace that
#  with a process substitution calling
#  get_string_length_printable() -- which should be renamed to
#  get_string_length_printable(), incidentally.
#
#Theoretically, that should do it. *shrug*

    #FUXME: Documentation outdated.
    # Else, such line length is greater than 1, the common case. Dismantled,
    # this is:
    #
    # * "\h*+", matching ignorable horizontal whitespace (i.e., non-newline)
    #   without backtracking, for efficiency.

    #   * "\n", a newline to ${match[1]}. Such newline will typically be printed

    #     word delimiter to ${match[2]} with:
    #     * ".{...}", matching all characters in such line excluding the last
    #       character.
    #     * "[^-]|(-)", matching the last character in such line. If such
    #       character is a hyphen, capture such hyphen to ${match[3]} to enable
    #       the following condition to test whether a hyphen matched.
    #     * "(?(-1)|(?:...))", matching either:
    #       * If a hyphen suffix previously matched, then nothing else.
    #       * Else, one of the following suffixes:
    #         * Mandatory horizontal whitespace.
    #         * A newline.
    #         * The string end.
    #         In any case, such suffix will typically be converted into a single
    #         newline by the caller.
    #   * "(.{...})", matching a line's worth of text *NOT* suffixed by a word
    #     delimiter. This fallback condition handles such edge
    #     cases as single words exceeding the length of a single line, without
    #     which such words would be silently ignored during PCRE iteration. In
    #     such case, such words will typically be broken at the passed line
    #     length into substrings suffixed by a hyphen followed by a newline.
    #     Hence, match the line length minus one.
    # * "\n?", matching an ignorable newline suffixing such text. Since the
    #   caller typically suffixes such text by a newline already, an additional
    #   newline should not be captured and hence printed as well.

#Print the passed string wrapped to the current terminal width, prefixing each
#resulting line with the passed prefix. Specifically:
#
#. Split such string into substrings satisfying the following constraints:
#** Each substring is suffixed by either whitespace or the end of such string.
#** Each substring is no longer than the current terminal width subtracted by the
#   length of such prefix.
#. Print each substring prefixed by such prefix and suffixed by a newline.
