#FIXME: Pretty sweet snippet adding a Vim-style modeline in vi-keys mode showing
#whether currently in INSERT or NORMAL mode. I reckon we could ably integrate
#this into the default theme, which would go a long way to converting me to
#the vi-keys ZLE. See:
#http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2006/msg01180.html
#http://www.gott-gehabt.de/800_wer_wir_sind/thomas/Homepage/Computer/zsh/vi-showmode
#Perhaps there's a more recent working solution, as well?
#FIXME: Sweet! While zsh itself doesn't provide a visual mode for its emulation, an
#enterprising zsh user has written a set of ZLE functions doing so; see:
#https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~raybuntu/+junk/ZSH_stuff/view/head:/zle_vi_visual.zsh
#The same code includes an incredibly helpful series of functions
#automatically copying text yanked at the zsh command line into the X
#clipboard. Definitely essential. I've wanted that *FOREVER*!
#FIXME: Hmm; this looks to be quite promising as well. Approaches galore!

#FIXME: zsh helpfully provides a "DVORAK" setopt option, only of interest if
#interactive. It'd be quite nice to dynamically determine whether a dvorak
#keymap is currently in use and, if so, implicitly enable such option.
#However, this fails to account for hardware-based keymapping (e.g.,
#Kinesis). Perhaps a "config" global -- say, ZESHY_IS_KEYMAP_DVORAK" -- would
#be of assistance here.
