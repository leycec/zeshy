    #FIXME: Not quite right; this conditional succeeds on command lines
    #resembling "ls 2>&1", but shouldn't. It's exceedingly difficult to
    #reliably determine whether or not such command requires shell
    #interpretation; so, just excise this conditional altogether. What follows
    #is generally reliable and, in fact, more precise, as we can pass intervals
    #in units other than seconds to the sleep() builtin.
    #FIXME: Actually, it'd be helpful to still retain the first conditional in
    #a *SEPARATE* function perhaps name run_code_runnable_every_interval() to
    #differentiate from this more general function.

    # If the passed command is an external command, run under "watch", a POSIX-
    # standard command with an efficiently aesthetic CLI supporting only
    # external commands.

            #FIXME: We could actually make this reasonably precise; ideally, we
            #want to run the passed command precisely on the passed interval.
            #But the current implementation just sleeps for the passed interval.
            #Not at all the same thing, particularly for commands that take
            #somewhat long to complete. Instead, get the current time before and
            #after executing such command. Subtract the positive difference
            #between the two from the desired interval; the resulting float is
            #the exact number of time units to sleep this iteration. Simple.
            #Ah! Wait. There's an even simpler means. The prior iteration should
            #calculate the time at which the next iteration should run such
            #command; then, in the next iteration, just get the current time...
            #Hmm. Perhaps that's not simpler at all, actually. O.K.; constrain
            #everything to the current iteration. For simplicity, go with the
            #first idea above.
            # Run and sleep. (Just like in real life.)
