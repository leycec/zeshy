...    "Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged
...     in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs,
...     working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the
...     same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so
...     cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a
...     sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would
...     take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would
...     go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought
...     demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins,
...     some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in
...     making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much
...     leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while
...     half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the
...     unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a

Undefine all passed *non-suffix aliases* (i.e., simple or global aliases).
While calling undefine_alias() also suffices to undefine such aliases, this
function needs no iteration and is hence considerably more efficient than that
function when all such aliases are non-suffix aliases.

Disable all passed *non-suffix aliases* (i.e., normal or global aliases). Such
aliases will behave as if undefined until subsequently reenabled by a call to
:enable_alias_nonsuffix().
/---

void :enable_alias_nonsuffix(string alias_name1, ...)

Reenable all passed *non-suffix aliases* (i.e., normal or global aliases).
After this call, such aliases will behave as if defined and hence be expanded
where referenced. Since aliases are enabled by default, this function is
typically only called after a prior call to :disable_alias_nonsuffix().

#genuinely means something; "normal" really doesn't. Everything's "normal" from
#some vantage point.
