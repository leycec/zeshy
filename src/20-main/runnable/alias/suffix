declare_parcel_as_script_with_stdin <<'/---'
Handle *suffix aliases* (i.e., aliases expanded on filetype for files in command
position).

#FIXME: Merge all such functionality back into the appropriate alias parcel
#(e.g., @{test}, @{set}).

Throw an exception with the passed message unless a suffix alias exists for the
filetype of the passed file. See is_file_runnable_by_alias_suffix:() for further details.

}

Report success if the passed file is suffixed by a nonempty filetype _and_ a

Get *suffix alias bindings* (i.e., declarations with definitions) for all passed
filetypes, in the passed order: e.g.,

.get_alias_suffix_binding()

void :set_string_to_alias_suffix_binding(

Set the passed string variable to the concatenation of all bindings for the
passed *non-suffix aliases* (i.e., simple and global aliases) in the passed
order. For each such alias, the corresponding binding is exactly one evaluable
command declaring _and_ defining such alias: e.g.,
