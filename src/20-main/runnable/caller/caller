[status: bool] :is_caller_caller()

Report success if this function was called by a *runnable* (i.e., function or
script), which itself was called by a runnable. Equivalently, report success if:

* A *caller's caller* (i.e., runnable that called the runnable that called this
  function) exists.
* The call stack contains at least three runnables (in the context of this
  function).

void :set_string_to_caller(string string_name)

Set the passed string variable to the name of the *caller's caller* (i.e.,
runnable that called the runnable that called this function). If no such caller
exists (e.g., this function was either called directly from the command line or
by a runnable called directly from the command line), an exception is thrown.

== Caller Names ==

If such caller was:

* A `zeshy` function, this is such function's name.
* A `zeshy` script, this is the absolute _or_ relative path such script was
  originally run as.
* An evaluation, this is `(eval)`.
