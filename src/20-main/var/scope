# Sadly, type strings of local but *NOT* global variables are explicitly
# suffixed by a suffix specific to such variables. Thus, type strings of the
# latter are matchable only by matching type strings either:
#
# * *NOT* containing delimiter "-" (and hence implicitly global).
# * Containing delimiter "-" suffixed by an suffix other than "local" (and
#   hence implicitly global).
#
# While extended globs lack support for the generalized negative lookahead and
# lookbehind assertions now supported by most PCRE implementations, they *DO*
# support negative character classes. Since no type suffix other than "-local"
# starts with "l", negating such letter suffices to match the desired strings.
