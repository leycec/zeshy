declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_SYSTEM_ID <<'/---'
`.`-delimited string uniquely identifying the *current system* (i.e., the
concatenation of the names of all high-level software on which the current
digest file depends). This includes such software as:

* The current operating system (e.g., `linux-gnu`).
* The current operating system distribution if any (e.g., `Gentoo`).
* The current window manager if any (e.g., `FVWM`).

This global is guaranteed to contain no whitespace and hence is unlikely to be
human-readable. Rather, this global is principally intended for use in
constructing system-specific paths (e.g.,
`~/.zeshy/config/linux-gnu.Gentoo.FVWM`).

declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_DISPLAY_SERVER_NAME <<'/---'
Name of the *current display server* (i.e., the core component of the current
windowing system, defining the communications protocol with which client GUI
applications receive input and render output) if the current display is managed
by a display server or the empty string otherwise. Such string may contain
whitespace and capitalized letters and hence is typically human-readable.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENT_NAME <<'/---'
Name of the *current desktop environment* (i.e., the component of the current
windowing system implementing the desktop metaphor for the current display of
the current display server) if the current display is managed by a display
server or the empty string otherwise. Such string may contain whitespace and
capitalized letters and hence is typically human-readable.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_WINDOW_MANAGER_NAME <<'/---'
Name of the *current window manager* (i.e., the component of the current
windowing system managing windows for the current display of the current display
server) if the current display is managed by a display server or the empty
string otherwise. Such string may contain whitespace and capitalized letters and
hence is typically human-readable.

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
void ::set_digest_system_globals(void)

Define all system-specific globals required by @{digest}. Specifically, set the
following globals by inspecting the current system: ${ZESHY_SYSTEM_ID} and
${ZESHY_WINDOW_MANAGER_NAME}.
/---

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
void ::set_digest_system_globals_x(void)

Define all system-specific globals required by @{digest} for display servers
supporting the X11 protocol, which this function implicitly assumes to be the
case. This function is only intended to be called by
:set_digest_system_globals().
