float get_path_time_for_format(string pathname, char format)

Get the time corresponding to the passed format character for the passed path.
Such time is in high-resolution fractional seconds since the Unix epoch,
typically accurate to the nanosecond. Such character must be one of the
following `stat`-specific format specifiers:

* `x`, getting such path's access time.
* `y`, getting such path's modification time.
* `z`, getting such path's change time.

See get_time() and `man stat` for further details: e.g.,

#FIXME: The BSD version of "stat" actually implicitly supports floating point
#times, which is quite a bit better than the situation on Linux. (Nice reversal,
#BSD!) See
#https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/stat.1.html
#
#I really can't be bothered to implement support at the moment, but there it is.
#Hopefully, by the time this becomes a concern, zsh revises zstat() to support
#high resolution times. :)

# Sadly, zsh's zstat() fails to support retrieval of high-resolution file times,
# even under systems recording such times (e.g., post-2.6 Linux kernels). Until
# such support is added, retrieve such times by cobbling together the expected
# fractional Unix time from the output of the GNU-specific "stat"
# implementation: e.g.,
#
#     # Print the current modification time for standard output in both human-
#     # and machine-readable format, delimited by "~~~". Note that the former
#     # provides the desired fractional portion and the latter the desired
#     # integer portion. Grafting the two together yields the expected time:
#     # 1369265941.436503138.
#     >>> stat --dereference --printf '%y~~~%Y' /dev/fd/1
#     2013-05-22 19:39:01.436503138 -0400~~~1369265941
#
# If the current "stat" implementation is non-GNU, retrieve the typical low-
# resolution file times. (Technically, we could add support for the BSD-specific
# "stat" implementation, but it hardly seems worth it. zsh's zstat() *SHOULD*
# add support for higher resolution by the time this becomes a larger concern.)

#FIXME: This can be made quite a bit more efficient. Specifically, perform the
#test of whether or not "stat" outputs in the desired format *HERE* in the outer
#conditional. Test "/dev/stdout" if such path exists, which is pretty much
#guaranteed when "stat" is a GNU pathable.
