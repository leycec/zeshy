    :list_path_verbose_sans_content_sorted_by_mtime_descending(
        string pathname1, ...)

Verbosely list the passed paths themselves -- rather than the content such paths
contain -- with the currently configured `ls`-specific options (e.g.,
${ZESHY_OPTIONS_LS_FROM_LINUX}), sorted in descending order of *mtime* (i.e., the
last time the contents of such paths were modified). Specifically, for each
such:

* File, verbosely list such filename. (This is unchanged from default `ls`
  behaviour.)
* Directory, verbosely list such directory but neither the files or
  subdirectories such directory contains. (By default, `ls` lists both.)
* Symbolic link, verbosely list such link but not the target of such link. (By
  default, `ls` lists both.)

See list_path_verbosely_with_options() and get_path_mtime() for further details.

Recursively verbosely list all directories found under the passed directory
(defaulting to the current directory, if called directly from the command line)
but _not_ the files or subdirectories such directories contain, sorted in
descending order of *directory mtime* (i.e., the last time a path was added to,
removed from, or renamed in such directories). See :get_path_mtime() for
further details.
