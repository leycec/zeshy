# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy Regex, implementing supplementary regular expression-handling
# functionality (over that already implemented by Zeshy Core).
#
# --------------------( CONVENTIONS                        )--------------------
# All regular expressions matched by this component are Perl-compatible regular
# expressions (PCRE), unless otherwise stated. Thus, we abbreviate such regular
# expressions "regexes."
# 
# All functions defined by this component accept the same number and type of
# parameters as the core match() function, unless otherwise stated. Thus, we
# abbreviate such parameters "...". 
#
# --------------------( TODO                               )--------------------
# * Uhm; the "[[ ... =~ ... ]]" operator sets globals "${MATCH}" and "${match}"
#   on success, thus providing a far more concise and probably efficient
#   alternative to our current implementation. That said, the current
#   implementation does permit the user of caller-specific variables, which is
#   nice. Hence, we could improve the match() function with an optimization in
#   the case the caller accepts the default variable names. For further details,
#   see section "Conditional Expressions" under "info zsh".
# * Provide a glob-specific equivalent to the get_*match() family of functions.
#   The (M) flag to #- and %-style matches appears to support this, if crudely.

# int get_match_count(...)

# function counts occurrences of characters and substrings in strings: e.g.,
#
#     >>> get_number_of_matches 'rop[aeiou]' 'anthropocene tropes'
#     2
#
# See also the get_number_of_glob_matches() function, which behaves similarly
# but less efficiently -- matching via multiple glob rather than one regular
# expression.

    # Sadly, neither sed, awk, grep, or zsh itself have any coherent means of
    # matching individual occurences regardless of newline; rather, they only
    # match each such occurence as a newline-specific group. This hack uses this
    # newline obsession by replacing each match with that match suffixed by a
    # newline. This guarantees no more than one match occupies each line.

    # and hence the number of matches. (Yeth, this sucketh mightily.)

# Match the passed string or stdin if no such string is passed against the
# passed Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE). This function returns
# failure if this string does not match and success otherwise, as well as
# setting match group-specific variables in the latter case:
#
# * The name of the scalar variable to which this function puts the whole match,
#   defaulting to the global variable "${MATCH}".
# * The name of the array variable to which this function puts all match groups,
#   defaulting to the global variable "${match}".

# exact text matched, you must either access the above match group-specific
# variables or call a helper function defined by Zeshy Regex.

# This function also accepts a hidden "fifth parameter": the global variable
# "${ZESHY_MATCH_OPTIONS}", which when set causes this function to pass those
# options to the pcre_compile() built-in when compiling the passed pattern.

# than an explicit passed string: e.g.,
