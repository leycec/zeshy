# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy Module, implementing Zsh module-handling functionality.

# ....................{ TESTING                            }....................
#FIXME: Uhm; how actually does one do this? The Zsh manual explicitly suggests
#the best method is:
#
#    quietly zmodload "${1}"
#
#But this is demonstrably silly. A test method shouldn't actually have non-
#idempotent side effects.

# void is_module(char *module_name)
#
# Return true if Zsh provides some module with the passed name.
#is_module() {
#    die_unless_one_arg 'expected exactly one module name'
#    zmodload "${1}"
#}

# ....................{ LOADING                            }....................
# void load_module(char *module_name)
#
# Load the module with the passed name.
load_module() {
    die_unless_one_arg 'expected exactly one module name'
    zmodload "${1}"
}

# void unload_module(char *module_name)
#
# Unload the module with the passed name.
unload_module() {
    die_unless_one_arg 'expected exactly one module name'

    # Dismantled, this is:
    #
    # * "u", unloading this module.
    # * "i", a noop if this module is not currently loaded.
    zmodload -ui "${1}"
}
