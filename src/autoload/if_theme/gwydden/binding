# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy Binding, implementing interactive key bindings: e.g.,
#
# * <Alt-P>,  search history for commands starting with "this."
# * <Ctrl-R>, search history for commands containing "this."

    # Disable flow control key bindings conflicting with those of popular
    # command-line applications (e.g., irssi, rtorrent). Specifically, prevent
    # <Ctrl-s> and <Ctrl-q> from disabling and enabling flow control.
