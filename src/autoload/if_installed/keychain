# Zeshy Keychain, implementing "keychain"-driven SSH and GnuPG key caching.

    # immediately. "Nothing to see here, folks..."

#FIXME: Obsolete.
# Remove all cached keys from the keychain, for safety. Note that all calls
# to this script must temporarily clear any "${GREP_OPTIONS}" when doing so,
# as this script expects default "grep" options. (Fair enough, friend.)
#GREP_OPTIONS='' keychain --clear
