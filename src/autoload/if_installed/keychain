# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy Keychain, handling "keychain", a CLI for SSH and GnuPG key caching.

# ....................{ FUNCTIONS                          }....................
# void set_default_keychain(void)
#
# Initialize the "keychain" script. This is a third-party script not bundled
# with Zeshy but providing helpful functionality: namely, caching of GnuPG and
# SSH public/private key pairs via a command-line interface.
set_default_keychain() {
    die_unless_no_arguments

    # Remove all currently cached keys from the keychain, for safety.
    keychain --clear

    # If a permissible SSH public key exists for this user, cache it.
    string ssh_public_key_path=$(which_files "${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa" "${HOME}/.ssh/id_dsa")
    is_nonempty "${ssh_public_key_path}" and
        eval $(keychain --eval --quick "${ssh_public_key_path}")
}

#FIXME: Obsolete.
# Remove all cached keys from the keychain, for safety. Note that all calls
# to this script must temporarily clear any "${GREP_OPTIONS}" when doing so,
# as this script expects default "grep" options. (Fair enough, friend.)
#GREP_OPTIONS='' keychain --clear
