#
# Display udev-specific device information for the passed filename, typically a
# device file under the /dev pseudo-filesystem. This function is particularly
# helpful for obtaining udev-associated "Product" and "Vendor" strings for a
# device, with which you may then write custom udev, X.org, etc. rules for
# dynamically configuring devices on "hot-plug."
