# Zeshy Gentoo Developer, handling Gentoo development (e.g., ebuild, eclass).

#FIXME: Hmm; just merge into "portage"?
# ....................{ CHECKERS                           }....................
# void check_portage(string repository_dir = get_current_dir())
#
# Check the passed Portage repository (defaulting to the repository containing
# the current directory), for quality assurance.

    die_unless_no_or_one_arg 'expected optional dirname'

    else
        #FIXME: If this becomes a common idiom, it'd be nice to add a new
        #run_under_dir() function: e.g., "run_under_dir "${1}" repoman".
