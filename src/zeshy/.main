# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy All. This Zeshy components imports all other Zeshy dependencies in a
# "system-sensitive" manner: i.e., importing only specific dependencies
# relevant to the current system.
#
# --------------------( TODO                               )--------------------
# * All binary-specific functions (e.g., screenify()) should be moved into a new
#   "zeshy/command/" directory, with one file under that directory per binary:
#   "zeshy/command/screen", "zeshy/command/mysql", and so forth. Then, the
#   "zeshy/command/main" dynamically imports all scripts in that directory
#   (ignoring itself, of course) which are also installed on the current system.
#   Bloody sweet, no? Though one could quite see that becoming expensive
#   quickly. Long-term, an autoload solution is far more elegant.

# means:
#
# * All scripts immediately under "zeshy/".

#   (e.g., "zeshy/distro/exherbo" on Exherbo systems).
