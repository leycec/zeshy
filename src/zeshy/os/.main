# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy OS. This Zeshy component implements operating system functionality
# generic to all operation systems.

# ....................{ IMPORTS                            }....................
zimport zeshy/string

# void _zeshy_os(void)
#
# Import Zeshy components specific to the current OS.

}

# ....................{ OS                                 }....................
# void get_os_name(void)
#
# Get the (strictly lowercase) name of the distro running on the current system:
# e.g.,
#
#     >>> get_os_name
#     freebsd   # under FreeBSD systems
#     gnu-linux # under GNU/Linux systems
get_os_name() {
    # "uname" reports Linux as "GNU/Linux", so replace backslashes with dashes.

# The following functions are OS-specific, and thus defined for each OS-specific
# Zeshy component, elsewhere. By default, each dies with error.

# char *get_current_process_basename(void)
#
# Get the basename of the binary corresponding to the current process.
get_current_process_basename() { die "unimplemented on $(get_os_name)" }

# char *get_current_process_command_line(void)
#
# Get the command line under which the current process is executing. This is a
# single string having these parts:
#
# * Absolute OR relative path to the executable file from which the process was
#   executed. Note that, in the latter case, there is no reliable mechanism for
#   converting the relative path into an absolute path.
#
# Due to the above unreliabilities, this string is best used for displaying non-
# critical log and user interface labels rather than critical functionality.
