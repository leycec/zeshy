# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy System. This Zeshy component implements operating system-specific
# functionality: typically, harvesting metadata from such subsystems as the
# "/proc" and "/sys" pseudo-filesystems (under Linux).

# void get_distro_name(void)

# Get the (strictly lowercase) name of the distro running on the current system:
# e.g.,
#
#     >>> get_distro_name
#     exherbo   # under Exherbo systems
#     gentoo    # under Gentoo systems

    then echo 'exherbo'
    elif [[ -f '/etc/gentoo' ]]
    then echo 'gentoo'
    else lowercase $(uname --operating-system)
