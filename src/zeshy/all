# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy. This top-level script sources all other Zeshy dependencies, and should
# only itself be sourced by scripts requiring all such dependencies.

# ....................{ DEPENDENCIES                       }....................
# Destroy all existing aliases and functions. While destructive, this does guard
# against desynchronization issues resulting from modification to the current
# Zeshy installation (e.g., as when upgrading).
unalias    -m '*'
unfunction -m '*'

# Zeshy home directory, if not already set.
[[ -z "${ZESHY_HOME}" ]] ||
    export ZESHY_HOME=$(readlink --canonicalize-existing $(dirname "${0}"))

# Source "zeshy.core" prior to importing all other dependencies, however, as
# that script defines the import() function called below.
local zeshy_core_path="${ZESHY_HOME}/zeshy.core"
source "${zeshy_core_path}"

#FIXME: "exherbo" should definitely be moved elsewhere. "ssh" probably should
#be. "git" is probably fine, but should be examined.... closely.
# Source all shell scripts whose names start with "zeshy." in this directory,
# as these scripts constitute the set of all dependencies for this script.
# 
# Importation order is not important, as all dependencies use the "import"
# mechanism to specifically import their sub-dependencies as required.

    import "${script_name}"

# Permit input and output of meta characters (i.e., characters having the eighth
# bit set). Do not do this in Zeshy Core (although that would be preferable), as
# that appears to add these arguments to the current argument list "${@}".
