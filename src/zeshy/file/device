# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy Disk, implementing filesystem-handling.
#
# --------------------( TODO                               )--------------------
# * Add support for disk cloning. To be blunt, it's highly non-trivial and
#   rather dangerous (an understatement); but, current Linux command-line
#   support for such cloning only excacerbates this issue by unsafely admitting
#   inherently damaging operations (e.g., "dd"-ing onto a mounted partition).
#   Disk cloning requires two separate actions:
#   1. First, cloning the partition(s) header(s) and ensuring the output disk or
#      partition is at least as large as the input disk or partition. Assuming
#      an output disk of /dev/sdb and input disk of /dev/sda, this is achievable
#      by running:
#      sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdb
#   2. Second, cloning the actual disk or partition ("dd" operates on either
#      transparently, since both are device files). This is somewhat complicated
#      by the lack of a progress bar for "dd" and the need to prevent "dd" from
#      committing blatantly damaging data deletion. Specifically:
#      1. If the output is a disk, validate that no partition of that disk is
#         currently mounted. If the output is a partition, validate that that
#         partition is currently unmounted. Note that this implicitly guards
#         against overwriting of the main hard drive in use.
#      2. Validate that the output disk or partition is at least as large as the
#         input disk or partition. Note that the output may be an ".img" file,
#         thus somewhat complicating such checks.
#      2. Interactively confirm the user wishes to do so with ask_bool().
#      3. Perform the actual clone with "pv" (pipe view) if installed, providing
#         a visual progress bar: e.g.,
#         dd if=/dev/sda bs=32M | pv -s 512M | dd bs=32M of=/dev/sdb 
#         The "bs" (block size) argument is essential to provide decent
#         throughput. Being an archaic application, "dd" defaults to an absurd
#         512KB block size; anything from 4MB to 128MB appears to be the current 
#         preferred default. Since "pv" can't reasonably know the full size of
#         data being transferred, we provide it the explicit size with "-s".
