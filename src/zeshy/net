# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy Net. This Zeshy component implements network-handling functionality.

# --------------------( IP ADDRESSES                       )--------------------
# void unbind_ip_address(char *ip_address, char *device_name)
#
# Unbind the passed IP address from the network device having the passed name:
# e.g.,
#
#     >>> unbind_ip_address 10.0.0.2 eth0
unbind_ip_address() {
    [[ "${#}" -eq 2 ]] || die 'expected one IP address and one device name'

    #FIXME: Add support for "ifconfig", if "ip" not runnable. Also, ensure that
    #"${2}" refers to a real network device.
    try ip addr del "${1}" dev "${2}"
}
