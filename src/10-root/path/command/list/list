# Unfortunately, POSIX "ls" returns exit status 2 on non-fatal errors, including
# non-permission to access a nested path when run recursively. While zeshy could
# theoretically define new list_path*() functions coercing such exit status to
# 0, doing so requires either prefiltering passed paths for nested paths to
# which the current user has no read or execute permissions *OR* postfiltering
# "ls" output to detect such contexts. The former, though simpler, remains non-
# trivial: by recursing all applicable paths before running "ls", we guarantee
# different output than is output by "ls -R" unless we again postprocess "ls"
# output; additionally, portably passing such paths to "ls" requires a zargs()-
# driven passing style. Since the effort in either case substantially outweighs
# the gain, reluctantly retain the POSIX exit status model.

#FUXME: Not the best nomenclature. The recursion is far more important than the
#verbosity, so rename to list_path_recursive_verbosely() here and below.

# concisely and hence excluding path metadata (e.g., owner, permissions) and hence
#include only path basenames
#FUXME: Annoyingly, "command ls" returns non-zero exit status 2 when passed "-R"
#and at least *ONE* path recursively under the passed path cannot be read by the
#current user. Ideally, such paths should simply be ignored. "man ls" indicates
#"ls" should be returning 2 *ONLY* "if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access
#command-line argument)." Since no serious (or even minor) trouble exists here,
#I can only conjecture such return value to be in error. Amend this here. The
#implementation should call an underlying list_path_recursive_with_options()
#function rather the current "command ls"; such function should, in turn,
#capture output in the exact same manner as run_code_with_options(). (In fact, we'd
#might as well reimplement the exact subset of such function applicable to this
#functionality and stop calling run_code_with_options().) Given captured output,
#parse such output on receiving exit status 2; if such output contains a line
#matching "ls: cannot open directory ./${DIRNAME_HERE}: Permission denied",
#return exit status 0 instead.
#FUXME: To test exit status, we'll probably need a new function based on
#report_status(). See such function for the basic implementation;
#shouldn't be terribly difficult. (Clever implementation, actually. Nice, man.)
#FUXME: Actually, string matching sucks. *REALLY* sucks. Couldn't we just
#perform such recursion ourselves at the same time we filter away non-readable
#paths? Yesss. Don't see why not, really... Ah; the only issue is argument
#length: as I recall, we'll probably have to user builtin zargs() to guarantee
#sane behavior. Hmmm; actually, this is non-ideal, largely because "ls" output
#changes under option "-R" to produce more aesthetically pleasing details. More
#importantly, we want to retain the existing warnings; we just want to cease
#such warnings from inducing non-zero exit status. Go with the initial plan,
#please.
#FUXME: Actually, how do we even reliably go with the initial plan? The problem,
#as I see it, is that we'd need to distinguish between a real fatal error and
#a "fake" permissions-related fatal error. If at least one real fatal error was
#printed, we'd need to retain non-zero exit status. Ow! That substantially puts
#a damper on things, eh? O.K.; so, it appears we'll have to emulate "lr -R"
#output; annoying, but hardly infeasible. It will be substantially slower,
#however. O.K.; this is all a bit of a pipe-dream at the moment. Retain the
#existing exit status...and try to eventually come back to this.

#FUXME: Drop the "_concisely". It's a reasonable default; we needn't specify it.
#Indeed, doing so unnecessarily increases complexity elsewhere.
