types of command to be run for files of such media types). See

[status: bool] :is_media_type_action(string action_name)

Report success if the passed string is a valid media type action. Specifically,
report success if such string equals one of the following:

* `compose`, creating files of the desired media type.
* `edit`, editing files of the desired media type.
* `print`, printing such file of the desired media type.
* `see`, viewing such file of the desired media type.

#FIXME: Oh, boy. We really need to emphasize what such functions are actually
#doing in their nomenclature. (Not to mention the fact that print_file()
#contravenes *ALL* our other nomenclature.) Rename to:
#
#* From edit_file() to run_file_editor:().
#* From print_file() to run_file_printer:().
#* From view_file() to run_file_viewer:().
#FIXME: OH, BOY. Good Lord. As defined, such functions require the external
#command "run-mailcap" to be installed and commands "compose", "edit", "print",
#and "view" to be symbolic links to such command. I have to be honest: this is
#fairly silly. The last thing we require (particularly in core components such
#as this) are additional external dependencies. (Moreover, such symbolic links
#conflict with those already provided by most systems -- including "view", which
#"vim" typically symbolic links to itself). Sadly, zsh's builtin retinue of
#MIME-related autoloadable functions (e.g., "/usr/share/zsh/*/function/MIME")
#only support handling of the default action associated with media types -- not
#arbitrary actions (e.g., "compose", "edit"). While we certainly should kill two
#fetid birds with one stone by reimplementing such autoloads as pure-zeshy
#functions generalized to support arbitrary media actions, this is all a bit
#beyond the pale at the moment. Hence, for now, we disable *EVERYTHING* here.
#FIXME: Interesting. If "xdg-mime" is installed (as it usually is, *UNLIKE* the
#"run-mailcap" command), such Bourne shell script probably provides a preferable
#method. When run under a desktop environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE, Xfce), such
#script provides output resembling:
#
#    >>> xdg-mime query default image/jpeg
#    gpicview.desktop;
#
#Where "gpicview.desktop" is a physical file in an appropriate system directory
#that, when run under such desktop environment, opens such application with the
#passed file(s). This is preferable since, for most users, it will "do the right
#thing," whereas the older CLI-based "mailcap" approach above will only behave
#sanely for users *NOT* running under such an environment.
#FIXME: Actually, "xdg-mime" and friends (e.g., "xdg-open") are often seen as
#rather sucky, due both to their Bourne shell implementations *AND* due to the
#opacity of their configurations. There consequently exist a retinue of
#alternatives, most providing their own custom plaintext configuration files.
#See "xdg-open replacements" on the following Arch wiki page:
#    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xdg-open#Drop-in_replacements_and_useful_tools
#FIXME: See @{browse} for related commentary.

#FIXME: This function should conditionally call *EITHER* the "compose" or "edit"
#actions, depending on whether such file actually exists or not.

#passed files). See is_media_type_pathable:() for further details. Such pathable must be a command in the current user's ${PATH}
#selected from the following list:
#

#* `edit`, editing such file.
#* `print`, printing such file.
#* `see`, viewing such file.

#    #Simply call the application associated with such file's filetype? In any
