== Caveats ==

This function is typically called as a getter function from command substitution
and hence subshell of the current shell. While typically safe, such substitution
is _inherently_ unsafe in the general case, in which the passed path is a
shell-specific symbolic link. In such case, consider calling
:set_string_to_file_text() instead. See :canonicalize_path() for further details.
/---
function get_file_text() {
    # Validate sanity.
    die_unless_arg 'Expected one filename.'
    string filename

    # Canonicalize such path. If such path is a symbolic link rather than text
    # file and we do *NOT* canonicalize such path from the former to latter,
    # attempting to index ${mapfile} by such path below fails with an error:
    # "get_file_text:21: mapfile[${filename}]: parameter not set". For safety,
    # prefer :set_string_to_path_canonical() to :canonicalize_path().
    :set_string_to_path_canonical filename "${1}"

    # Since symbolic links are *NOT* text files, test such path *AFTER*
    # canonicalizing such path.
    die_unless_file_text "${filename}"

    #FIXME: Actually, we should probably benchmark this for sufficiently large
    #files. While "mapfile" should be the fastest, "cat" might gives it a run
    #for its money.
    #FIXME: Use @with_module_mapfile instead.

    # Get such text. While precompiled zsh module "mapfile" provides the most
    # efficient access to such text, recall the following techniques to also
    # suffice:
    #
    #     >>> cat -- "${filename}"
    #     >>> :string.output "$(< "${filename}")"
    :load_module_mapfile
    {
        :string.output "${mapfile[${filename}]}"
    } always {
        :unload_module_mapfile
    }
}

# ....................{ GETTERS ~ count                    }....................
#FIXME: If "wc" is *NOT* pathable (hey; it could happen, particularly on BusyBox
#systems), such functions should provide pure-zeshy analogues. Such analogues
#will be quite slow and hence only serve as fallbacks in the absence of "wc".
