*Output pagers* (i.e., functions paging text through an external paging command
such as `more` or `less`).
/---

#FIXME: Nice! It looks like we can coerce "less" (if and only if less is the
#current ${PAGER}, of course) into displaying color, which is of particular
#interest for paging man pages. To do so, simply export string globals
#resembling:
#
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_mb=$(tput bold; tput setaf 2) # green
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_md=$(tput bold; tput setaf 6) # cyan
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_me=$(tput sgr0)
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_so=$(tput bold; tput setaf 3; tput setab 4) # yellow on blue
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_se=$(tput rmso; tput sgr0)
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_us=$(tput smul; tput bold; tput setaf 7) # white
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_ue=$(tput rmul; tput sgr0)
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_mr=$(tput rev)
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_mh=$(tput dim)
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_ZN=$(tput ssubm)
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_ZV=$(tput rsubm)
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_ZO=$(tput ssupm)
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_ZW=$(tput rsupm)
#
#This is fairly dark voodoo leveraging "termcap", the predecessor to "terminfo".
#"less" uses the former rather than the latter. For further details, see:
#
#    http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/119/colors-in-man-pages/147#147
#
#While substantially better than the default monochrome, the above colors could
#arguably be better. Unsure as yet. In any case, here's an alternative (smaller)
#scheme; interestingly, the screenshot for this one looks *QUITE* a bit better:
#
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_mb=$'\E[01;31m'       # begin blinking
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_md=$'\E[01;38;5;74m'  # begin bold
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_me=$'\E[0m'           # end mode
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_so=$'\E[38;5;246m'    # begin standout-mode - info box
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_se=$'\E[0m'           # end standout-mode
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_us=$'\E[04;38;5;146m' # begin underline
#    export LESS_TERMCAP_ue=$'\E[0m'           # end underline
#
#For further details on this one, see:
#
#    http://linuxtidbits.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/less-colors-for-man-pages/
#FIXME: We currently set string global ${PAGER} in @{zsh/variable/global}. Given
#the above improvements, however, both ${PAGER} and the above globals should be
#set in a new @{io/output/pager/global} parcel, and the current parcel shifted
#to @{io/output/pager/pager}.
#FIXME: Since there's really *NO* downside to unconditionally declaring the
#above "less"-specific globals even if the current pager is *NOT* "less", do the
#following:
#
#* If "less" is pathable (but regardless of whether "${PAGER}" is "less"),
#  declare the above ${LESS_TERMCAP_*} globals. Note such globals require
#  "color" globals to already have been declared, possibly necessitating we
#  shift @{io/color} to @{io/00-color} or even to @{*-core/io/color}. (The
#  latter is arguably a better choice).
#FIXME: Great. However, we'd like the choice of pager to be user-configurable.
#Since we already have a reasonable nomenclature for configuring command
#alternatives, let's reuse that to good effect by declaring a new list global
#${ZY_ALTERNATIVES_PAGER} in @{*-if_config/*-core/alternatives}. Then, we
#should define a new precompilation hook ::precompile_pager_globals() doing
#the following:
#
#* If ${PAGER} is undefined or empty, set such global to the first pathable in
#  ${ZY_ALTERNATIVES_PAGER} if any.
#* If "less" is pathable, define the above "less"-specific globals.
#
#Done!
#FIXME: O.K.; so, the above solution is certainly great. That said, if
#"lesspipe" is available, "lesspipe" should *ALWAYS* be preferred to "less".
#"lesspipe" is a "less" wrapper simplifying colorization. For details, run 
#"lesspipe -h".

#FIXME: *ALL* high-level functions wrapping external commands with options
#calling :code.run_paged() should instead prefix such command with "{" and suffix
#such command with "} | :stdin.page". The latter approach is quite a bit more
#responsive under interactive use.

#FIXME: When *NOT* paging, visually demarcate wrapped lines (ideally with color
#or perhaps simply with a simple prefix). So, rather than printing:
#
#udev                 /dev                      devtmpfs     rw nosuid relatime size=10240k nr_in
#odes=497142 mode=755
#
#  Instead, printing:
#
#udev                 /dev                      devtmpfs     rw nosuid relatime size=10240k nr_in
# ^-> odes=497142 mode=755
#
#  Or perhaps simply:
#
#udev                 /dev                      devtmpfs     rw nosuid relatime size=10240k nr_in
# ...odes=497142 mode=755
#
#  Or the slightly cleverer:
#
#udev                 /dev                      devtmpfs     rw nosuid relatime size=10240k nr...
# ..._inodes=497142 mode=755
#
#Actually, no. That reads awkwardly. One "..." is sufficient, I should think.
#Happily, "yppy" already has appropriate Unicode for the former arrows. In
#either case, I prefer a prefixing space on the wrapped line.

Page all passed strings with the current user's preferred pager (e.g., `less`)
if these strings cumulatively exceed the current terminal height _or_ print
these string without paging otherwise.

This function dynamically pages on an as-needed basis, thus implementing a
pseudo-intelligent context-sensitive pager.

#FIXME: As a slight improvement, make paging a bit "fuzzy." I've noticed that
#my eye, at least, would prefer paging not merely on text that's strictly too
#high but on text that's *SUFFICIENTLY* high. Sufficiently, is subjective, of
#course, so this should probably be user-configurable. I'm contemplating a
#default of 75% for such user-configurable global -- say:
#
#    ZY_PAGE_IF_TEXT_TO_TERMINAL_HEIGHT_PERCENT=75
#
#Then, page if the text height is greater than or equal to
#(( $(get_terminal_height) * ZY_PAGE_IF_TEXT_TO_TERMINAL_HEIGHT_PERCENT / 100 )).
#Should work great, yes?
#FIXME: Actually, it'd be better to just *CLEAR* the screen prior to printing
#such sufficiently tall text. The issue with tall text that still fits on the
#screen is not that such text isn't paged; it's that such text starts at a
#line number other than 1, which my eye (at least) expects for tall text.

:str :stdin.page[stdin=(:str text)]

Page standard input with the current user's preferred pager (e.g., `less`) if
this input exceeds the current terminal height _or_ print this input unpaged
otherwise.

For typical use, consider piping this function standard output from a block of
related commands to be paged together.

:str :code.run_paged(+:str codes)

Run the passed code with standard output and error piped to the current pager if
such output exceeds either the current terminal height or width or as is (i.e.,
without paging) otherwise.

Hence, this function implements an intelligent pager. Customary pager commands
block on standard input, thus delaying output until after the input command
completes operation. Resource-intensive commands not completing immediately
(e.g., `ls -R *`) thus block paging with no intermediate output until such
commands eventually complete. To rectify these interface woes, this function
immediately prints all output as received from the passed command to standard
error prior to paging this output, as needed.
