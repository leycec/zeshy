#FIXME: Investigate output formats.
#FIXME: If I had to learn any new language (aside from the obvious of
#JavaScript), it would probably be Elixer, a high-level multi-paradigmal
#language running on the Erlang VM. Whereas I felt strongly repulsed by Erlang's
#overly cumbersome syntax, Elixer's syntax melds lightweight Ruby syntax (e.g.,
#DSLs) and a few of the more lightweight syntactic constructs of conventional
#functional languages (e.g., pattern matching). In short, it's pretty cool.
#Their documentation, dynamically produced by ElixerDoc, also approximates a
#possible path forward for zeshy HTML output. It's quite good, as demonstrated:
