#== Comparison to set_variable_to_stdin_pipe() ==
#
#While set_variable_to_stdin() is callable in all cases in which this function is
#callable, this function is inherently safer than that function when receiving
#standard input from a pipe. In particular, if initializing and writing input to
#such pipe consumes more than the time that
#die_unless_stdin_readable_sans_blocking() internally waits for such input to
#become readable, set_variable_to_stdin() throws an exception. While acceptable
#in the general case, such behavior is certainly unacceptable here. Consider a
#system under heavy load, for example; since this function is _always_ piped
#input, initializing and writing such pipe could consume more than the time that
#die_unless_stdin_readable_sans_blocking() waits, though such write will usually
#eventually succeed. Hence, this function is strongly preferable to
#set_variable_to_stdin() whenever receiving piped standard input.

    # The prior instance of this function was named set_variable_to_stdin()
    # and, as such nomenclature suggests, called
    # die_unless_stdin_readable_sans_blocking() rather than merely
    # die_unless_stdin_pipe(). While this beneficially permitted such function
    # to be called under a wider array of contexts than the current instance of
    # this function, it also invited subtle issues. In particular, if
    # initializing and writing input to the pipe to such function consumed more
    # than the time that die_unless_stdin_readable_sans_blocking() internally
    # halts for such input to become readable, such function threw an exception.
    # While acceptable in the general case, such behavior is certainly
    # unacceptable here. Consider a system under heavy load, for example; since
    # this function is *ALWAYS* piped input, initializing and writing input to
    # such pipe could take considerably longer than the expected wait time,
    # though such write will eventually succeed.
    #
    # To correct this, the current instance of this function explicitly requires
    # piped input and implicitly, indefinitely, silently blocks on such input.
