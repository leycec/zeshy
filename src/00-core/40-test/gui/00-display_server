declare_parcel_as_script_with_stdin <<'/---'
Handle *display server testers* (i.e., high-level functions testing whether the
current display server -- the core component of windowing systems, defining the
communications protocol with which client GUI applications receive input and
render output -- is or is compatible with various well-known display servers).

[status: bool] :is_display_server(void)

Report success if output from the current shell is managed by a *display server*
(i.e., the core component of windowing systems, defining the communications
protocol with which client GUI applications receive input and render output).
Success implies the current shell to be running under a client of a currently
running display server, typically a GUI terminal (e.g., `terminator`).

# If the current OS:
#
# * Is Linux, test for all possible display servers (in descending order
#   of likelihood).
# * Is a proprietary OS mandating a single display server (e.g., OS X, Windows),
#   always succeed.
# * Is any other OS, test for all commonly ported display servers. Since neither
#   Wayland or Mir have been successfully ported to non-Linux OSes, this reduces
#   to testing for X.

#FIXME: Ideally, the current digest file should depend not only on the current
#OS but on the current display server and window manager. Once that's

#success or failure (as with @{*-test/*-os}).

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_display_server_x(void)

Report success if the current display server supports *X11* (i.e., the core
communications protocol of the X Window System). Such protocol is also referred
to as *X* or *X.Org* (i.e., the current reference implementation of an X11
display server developed by the X.Org Foundation).

== Caveats ==

*Success implies only that X11 applications may be reliably run.* Success does
_not_ imply that CLI utilities commonly bundled with the X.Org Server (e.g.,
"xauth", "xrdb") are pathable or otherwise available. Rephrased, success only
implies the current display server to _support_ X11 rather than to _be_ the
X.Org Server -- a significantly stronger claim. Indeed, several windowing
systems unaffiliated with the X.Org Foundation provide optional display servers
supporting the X11 protocol but _not_ such CLI utilities (e.g., XWayland, XMir).

    # running under X. Indeed, setting such variable in an environment *NOT*
    # running under X provokes calamity, suggesting that should never happen.

    # To corroborate such test, we could also test the existence of at least one
    # process running "${commands[X]}" as the current user *AND* listening to
    # the current value of ${DISPLAY}. However, since this function is called
    # comparatively early in zeshy startup, inlining process testing

#Since the

#FUXME: Ugh. Detecting whether the current shell is running under Mir or Wayland
#appears to be rather difficult. Neither appears to interect in any way closely
#with the shell. In particular, neither appears to export any requisite global
#variables. So how *DO* we detect such servers? Grep the process list. (Yes,
#this verascibly sucks.) For example, one suggested method online for checking
#whether or not Mir is currently running is:
#
#    >>> ps afx | grep unity-system-compositor
#
#But even *THAT* doesn't necessarily imply that the current shell is running
#under Mir (e.g., such shell could simply be running under a virtual console).
#For a truly reliable check, we'd need to test whether the current shell is
#transitively descended from such process.
#
#Now, you're probably thinking: that's horrible. And it is. *BUT*, since Mir and
#Wayland are effectively Linux-specific (although we recall reading about an
#effort to port Wayland to FreeBSD), we can effectively assume the GNU/Linux
#ecosystem of CLI utilities exists to implement such tests, which dramatically
#simplifies things. In any case, discomforting topics for another langorous day.
