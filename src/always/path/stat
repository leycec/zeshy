declare_parcel_as_script_with_stdin <<'/---'
Handle *path statistics* (i.e., POSIX-mandated metadata associated with all
files and directories regardless of filesystem type).

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_DEVICE_PARENT=1 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *device number* (i.e., unique identifier for the filesystem containing
such path on the current system).
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_INODE=2 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *inode* (i.e., unique identifier for such path on such filesystem).
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_MODE=3 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *mode* (i.e., integer concatenating such path's type and access
permissions). The last 9 bits of such mode define such permissions and all other
bits such type.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_HARD_LINK_COUNT=4 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *hard link count* (i.e., the number of hard links to such path on such
filesystem).
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_UID=5 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides the
numeric *user ID* of the owner of such path.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_GID=6 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides the
numeric *group ID* assigned to such path.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_DEVICE_NODE=7 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *major and minor device numbers* (i.e., unique identifiers of such
device's driver and such device respectively) if such path is a device file or 0
otherwise.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_SIZE_BYTES=8 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *symbolic bytesize* (i.e., number of bytes symbolically allocated to such
path on such filesystem). Such size is symbolic and hence guaranteed to be
greater than or equal to such path's physical bytesize. If such path is a:

* Regular file, this is the expected size.
* Directory, this is the number of bytes allocated to all *directory entries*
  (i.e., key-value pairs mapping filenames in such directory to such files'
  inodes) for such directory.
* Symbolic link, this is the length of such link's target pathname (excluding
  terminating null byte).
* Named pipe, this is the number of unread bytes remaining in such pipe.
* Device file, this is 0.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_TIME_CONTENT_READ=9 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *access time* (i.e., number of seconds since the Unix epoch at which such
path's content was last read), commonly abbreviated *atime*.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_TIME_CONTENT_CHANGED=10 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *modification time* (i.e., number of seconds since the Unix epoch at
which such path's content was last modified), commonly abbreviated *mtime*.

== Caveats ==

Since this time _only_ tracks changes to path content, renaming paths changes the
ctime (but _not_ mtime) for such path as well as the mtime and ctime of the
directory containing such path.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_TIME_INODE_CHANGED=11 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *inode change time* (i.e., number of seconds since the Unix epoch at
which such path's inode was last modified), commonly abbreviated *ctime*.

== Caveats ==

Since inodes persist metadata describing path content, any change to such
content updates both the mtime and ctime for such path.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_PREFERRED_SIZE_BLOCK_BYTES=12 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *preferred I/O block size in bytes* (i.e., number of bytes per block such
filesystem prefers such path be read or written with).
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_SIZE_BLOCKS=13 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *physical block count* (i.e., number of 512-byte blocks allocated to such
path on such filesystem). Such size is physical and hence guaranteed to be less
than or equal to such path's symbolic bytesize divided by 512 rounding up to the
nearest integer.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_SYMLINK_TARGET=14 <<'/---'
Index of lists set by set_list_to_path_stats:() whose list element provides such
path's *target path* (i.e., absolute or relative path to which such path
originally linked) if such path is a symbolic link or the empty string
otherwise. Unlike all other such list elements, this element is `zsh`-specific.
/---

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
void set_list_to_path_stats:(string list_name, string pathname)

Set the passed list to the raw values of all canonical statistics for the passed
path in the same order as returned by builtin zstat(), command `stat`, and
system call stat(). Since indexing such list with unreadable magic numbers is
discouraged, consider using human-readable globals ${ZESHY_STAT_*} instead
(e.g., ${ZESHY_STAT_INDEX_INODE}, expanding to the index into such list of the
list element providing such path's unique inode).

== Symbolic Links ==

*This function does not silently resolve symbolic links,* unlike builtin zstat()
and system call stat() but like commands `stat` and `ls`. If the passed path is
a symbolic link, the statistics describe such link itself rather the target path
of such link.

#If such path is a symbolic link, such statistics describe the transitive target
