Get the *mtime* (i.e., modification time) of the passed path in Unix time,
recursively. If such path is a:

* File, this is the same time as returned by get_path_mtime().
* Directory, this is the most recent modification time of such directory and
  all files and subdirectories of such directory, recursively.

    #
    # * "${pathname}"/**/*, all files and subdirectories of this directory.
    # * "om", such files and subdirectories in ascending order by mtime.
    # * "[1]", the first and hence newest such file or subdirectory.
