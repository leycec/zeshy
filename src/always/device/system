string torture_system(void)

Torture test the current system, typically to test system stability.

[CAUTION]
Monitor system temperatures when running such tests. If temperatures exceed
acceptable thresholds, *terminate this function immediately*. By definition,
acceptable thresholds differ with make and manufacturer. As a rule of thumb:
+
* Motherboard temperatures should ideally _not_ exceed 65째C and certainly _not_
  exceed 70째C.
* CPU temperatures should ideally _not_ exceed 75째C and certainly _not_ exceed
  80째C.

    #FUXME: Create a new print_message_block_ignoring_newlines(), to permit such
    #messages to be defined in a readable manner.
    #FUXME: "conky" is probably preferable for users having installed that.
    #FUXME: Spawn "monitor_sensors" ourselves for GUI-driven torture tests? Or
    #perhaps not, as users might require CLI output even in such case.
#   print_message 'consider monitoring CPU MCE errors with "mcelog" in another shell.'
    #FUXME: This highlights the need for a new function prefixing each line with
    #the message prefix (e.g., "zeshy: "). This approach of manually splitting
    #lines on an ad-hoc 80 characters obviously doesn't scale. Perhaps name the
    #function print_message_block().
