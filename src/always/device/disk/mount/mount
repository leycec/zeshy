# Handle device mounting and unmounting.

# * It'd be great to implement a pure-Zeshy alternative to the pure-bash
#   "devmon" script bundled with "udevil" for automounting. This script, while
#   lengthy, is well-written and readily translatable into Zeshy. (In fact, it
#   spends most of its length setting up simple functionality already provided
#   by Zeshy.) The core of "devmon" monitoring is a simple coprocess between it
#   and "udevil", which it regularly polls for new events. Simple parsing. I
#   reckon it'd be quite fun!

#FIXME: Split functions dealing with mount points into a new component
#"device/disk/mount/point".
#FIXME: When mounting by label, avoid accessing "/dev/disk/by-label/" symbolic
#links, which are notoriously unreliable. Rather, use option "-L" of external
#command "blkid", designed explicitly for such situations. In fact, mapping from
#disk labels to paths is a sufficiently important function to be a new function,
#don't you think? How about get_disk_labeled()? Simple; to the point!
#FIXME: The use of "awk" *EVERYWHERE* below is fairly hideous. Strip it out;
#replace it with pure-zeshy. A shame we didn't do so initially, eh? *sigh*

mount options as follows:

  readable list of current mount points.
* If the passed device does not exist, attempt to find a device with such
  basename under these directories (in order):
  * `/dev/disk/by-label`.
  * `/dev`.
  * ...otherwise, raise an exception.
* If no mount point was passed, assume a mount point with the passed device
  basename under the current user's mount home.
* If the passed mount point does not exist, recursively make it.
* If the passed mount point is already mounted to:
  * ...the passed device, do nothing.
  * ...otherwise, raise an exception.
* If the passed device is:
  * ...a device file, perform the expected mount.
  * ...a file with filetype `.iso`, mount this file as an ISO image.
