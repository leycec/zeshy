Print the passed text with the passed title, using user-configurable styles

string print_string_titled_with_style_prefix(
    string text, string title, string style_prefix)

Print the passed text with the passed title, using user-configurable styles
prefixed by the passed prefix. Specifically, print a ``box'' consisting of:

* Such title as a line horizontally centered in the current terminal, using
  user-configurable styles prefixed by `${style_prefix}heading.`.  See
  output_string_centered_with_style_prefix() for further details.
* Such text as one or more lines horizontally wrapped to the current terminal,
  using user-configurable styles prefixed by `${style_prefix}body.`.  See
  output_string_wrapped_with_style_prefix() for further details.
* The bottom edge of such box, using user-configurable styles prefixed by
  `${style_prefix}footing.`. Again, see
  output_string_centered_with_style_prefix() for further details.
