# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Bind keys to commands for interactive use at the command line. Default
# bindings include:
#
# * <Alt-p>, search history for commands starting with the current command-line.
# * <Ctrl-r>, search history for commands containing the current command-line.
# * <Esc-h>, display the man page for the command in the current command-line.
# * cd -<Tab>, change to the Nth oldest directory on the directory stack.
# * cd +<Tab>, change to the Nth newest directory on the directory stack.
#
# --------------------( TODO                               )--------------------
# * Untie key bindings from theme selection, perhaps by adding support for a
#   ${ZESHY_KEY_BINDINGS} global in the Zeshy configuration file *AND*
#   separating this file into a new "autoload/if_key_bindings/" directory.

#FIXME: Arguably, this component belongs in a new "line_editor" directory. Line
#editing strikes me more as a shell than terminal function. Yes, line editing
#requires a terminal to function... hmm; perhaps terminal's appropriate after
#all? Contemplate, some.

#FIXME: Very much non-ideal, but still wanted. The problem is the glob
#expression matched below: it's too simple. It currently matches *ANYWHERE*
#(e.g., the ".." in "2012~...And Death Said Live"), when ideally it should only
#match at the start of shell word boundaries. Shouldn't be terribly difficult to
#implement. Just do so, eh?
