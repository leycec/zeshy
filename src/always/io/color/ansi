Get the passed strings stripped of all color-specific ANSI escape codes. The
resulting string thus retains only non-color-specific ANSI escape codes (e.g.,
`\033[J`, clearing from the current cursor to the end of the current screen).

##FUXME: Bad nomenclature, I'm afraid. set_integer_to_string_length_printable()
##should be a general-purpose function and hence exclude the length of non-
##printable ANSI escape sequences. Hence, this function should be renamed to
##set_integer_to_string_length_printable() and shifted to a more appropriate
##parcel (e.g., @{variable/string/set}). Naturally, the existing
##get_string_ansiless_length_printable() function should internally defer to
##set_integer_to_string_length_printable().

    #FUXME: Rename "background_" to "background=" (e.g., "background_black" to

    #already delimits ANSI attributes external to map keys. And yes, I've confirmed
    #that map keys resembling "background=black" are usable in lists and maps
    #without requiring explicit quotation. Looks pretty nifty too, eh?

    #FUXME: Rename "intense_(*)" to "$1_intense" (e.g., "intense_black" to
    #"black_intense").
    #FUXME: Rename "background_" to "background-" (e.g., "background_black" to
    #"background-black").
#FUXME: Do the following two substrings apply only to CSI sequences or to OSC
#sequences as well? In the former case, we should probably rename this to, say,
#${ZESHY_ANSI_CSI_SGR_SUFFIX_NEXT}.

#substrings may be listed in any order within such string
#While substrings may be repeated, this is
#probably _not_ a wise idea.
#
#such that each element of such list is a `:`-delimited substring of such string
#${ZESHY_COLOR} keys (e.g., `grey_bold_italic`, the color grey in
#bold-italic typeface), whose corresponding values are the ANSI escape codes
#enabling such colors on the current terminal. See such map for further details.
#
#Colors include the canonical eight
#colors supported by most terminal emulators as well as "grey", a Zeshy-specific
#color leveraging "intense" ANSI attributes supported by most modern terminal
#emulators (e.g., rxvt-unicode). Color names include:
