Handle `zeshy`-specific paths.

#FIXME: Such globals should be set *MUCH* earlier in the startup logic --
#ideally, immediately after calling startup_zeshy_globals(). To ensure this,
#contemplate adding a new run_hook_on_zeshy_startup_globals() function; then,
#ensure that our startup_zeshy_globals() implementation calls all hooks
#registered in this manner.
#FIXME: Alternatively, this logic should *REALLY* be performed at digest
#compilation time. It's just too awkward to perform dynamically on each startup,
#especially when such logic is the same *EACH* time, most times. This implies
#that, when the user passes command-line option "--zeshy-dot-dir", @{main}
#should force a digest recompilation. This is perfectly acceptable, at the
#moment. Indeed, if need ever arose, such logic is readily optimizable by
#caching under "~/.zeshy/cache/digest/" digests specific to passed paths (e.g.,
#if the user runs "zeshy --zeshy-dot-dir ~/.akbar", compiling such digest to a
#new file "~/.zeshy/cache/digest/fi8uYWtiYXI.zwc", where "fi8uYWtiYXI" is the
#base64 encoding of "~/.akbar"). Note, in the prior example, that safely
#converting pathnames to basenames requires some encoding scheme: base64 is one,
#but there exist *MANY* others. Honestly, it would be most efficient to simply
#encode the two prohibited characters (i.e., directory separators and null
#characters). *shrug*
#FIXME: Right. Switch to setting such globals at precompilation time, as above!

# ....................{ PATHS                              }....................
# Such paths depend on command-line option "--zeshy-dot-dir" and hence cannot be
# defined until having matched such option (e.g., zeshy startup).

#FIXME: For consistency with function nomenclature, we should probably rename
#such globals as follows:
#
#* ${ZESHY_USER_COMPLETION_STARTUP_FILE} to ${ZESHY_USER_FILE_COMPLETION_STARTUP}.
#* ${ZESHY_USER_COMPLETION_RESULTS_DIR} to ${ZESHY_USER_DIR_COMPLETION_RESULTS}.
#* And so forth.
#
#The dominant noun (e.g., "file", "dir") comes first, as it does for functions,
#followed by additional specifiers. (Seems sensible, in any case!)
#
#Ah, yes! This is most definitely the way to go way? Consider: assuming
#${ZESHY_USER_DIR} expands to ${HOME} (which it should), a global resembling
#${ZESHY_USER_DIR_COMPLETION_RESULTS} expands to exactly what it reads as. Note
#that ${ZESHY_DIR_USER} is really no good, as such nomenclature implies such
#directory to be zeshy's user-specific directory (e.g., "~/.zeshy") rather than
#the user's home directory set under zeshy (e.g., "~/"). Or, perhaps not?
#${ZESHY_DIR_USER} *IS* the rational way to go. Considerations abound on all
#sides. Whichever way we go, I'll note that such a decision is considerably
#easier to switch to its alternate with a single regex than the current
#nomenclature approach.
#FIXME: Right. The ${ZESHY_DIR_USER_*} approach simply makes rational sense!

declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_USER_PID_DIR <<'/---'
Absolute path of the directory caching `zeshy`-managed process IDs. If the
current user has superuser privileges, this is a canonical system-wide directory
if such directory exists (e.g., `/run`, `/var/run`); else, this is a user-
specific subdirectory of `zeshy`\'s dot directory.

# ....................{ PATHS ~ temporary                  }....................
declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_DIR_TEMPORARY <<'/---'
Absolute path of the first temporary directory writable by the current user in
the following list (in order):

* `/tmp`, the canonical system-wide temporary home for non-persistent files.
* `/var/tmp`, the canonical system-wide temporary home for persistent files.
* `${HOME}/tmp`, the canonical user-specific temporary home.

== Design Decisions ==

System-wide temporary directories are often formatted under filesystems specific
to handling temporary paths (e.g., `tmpfs`) or mounted with options prohibiting
insecure operations (e.g., `noexec`). Since user-specific temporary directories
are rarely subject to the same beneficial constraints, the former are preferred.

Since core functionality frequently expands this global (e.g.,
make_path_temporary()), this global exists in lieu of a similar function (e.g.,
get_dir_temporary()). Moreover, the implementation of such function would call
get_dir_writable_first(), which itself transitively calls make_path_temporary(),
a recursive loop. To avoid such concerns, we prefer this global.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_DIR_USER_TEMPORARY <<'/---'
Absolute path of a temporary directory specific to both `zeshy` and the current
user (e.g., `/tmp/zeshy-leycec`). When writing `zeshy`-specific temporary paths,
such directory should be preferred to the more `zeshy`-agnostic temporary
directory ${ZESHY_DIR_TEMPORARY} (e.g., `/tmp`). Such precaution improves
filesystem organization, reduces pathname collision, and parallels similar
behavior in contemporary frameworks (e.g., KDE, ORBit).

Define `zeshy`-specific paths. Such paths depend on string global
${ZESHY_USER_CACHE_DIR} itself depending on optional command-line option
`--zeshy-dot-dir`. Hence, such paths must be defined on each `zeshy` startup
rather than statically precompiled into `zeshy`\'s user digest file.

    #FUXME: Either shift somewhere more appropriate or rename this function to
    #something more appropriate. It's pretty much just a grab-bag of
    #miscellaneous startup code, at the moment.

#FUXME: Since the dot directory can be changed from the command-line, this
#probably isn't quite right. Indeed, this should really be pushed out of this
#file and into the Zeshy codebase. (Unsure quite where, of course...)
