# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Define an interactive help system for publishing Zeshy documentation.

#FIXME: The search algorithm for finding the exact documentation in a file
#corresponding to a function is actually not terribly hard:
#
#1. Find the function definition in such file. Assuming there exists only one
#   such definition, which there should, this is the first string matching
#   "^function ${function_name}\(\)$" in such file.
#2. If the line immediately preceding such definition matches "^# .*$", then:
#   a. Search backwards one line at a time, prepending each line to a list of
#      such lines *UNTIL* a line fails to match "^#( .*)?$".
#   b. Search forwards one line at a time starting at the line that fails to
#      match, shifting off each line that fails to match
#      "^# [a-z_]+ ${function_name}\(.*$" from such list *UNTIL* matching such
#      line.
#   c. Such list now contains the desired in-order documentation. Tad
#      complicated, but well within the scope of reasonable feasibility. Note
#      it's not safe to simply begin searching for the first line matching
#      "^# [a-z_]+ ${function_name}\(.*$" in the file, due to "#FIXME" comments,
#      "TODO" sections, and the fact that "# also that_function()." Also happens
#      to match.
#3. Otherwise, no documentation has been authored for such function yet. Throw
#   an exception.
