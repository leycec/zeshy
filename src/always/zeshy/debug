void startup_zeshy_sanity(void)

Perform debug-specific sanity checks early in `zeshy` startup. Such checks throw
exceptions on aberrant insanity (e.g., the absence of core `zeshy` aliases,
functions, or globals), ensuring a sane working environment for subsequent
`zeshy` startup hooks and functionality.

    #FUXME: Immediately after startup_zeshy() calls startup_zeshy_aliases(), we
    #should call a new function startup_zeshy_sanity() *IF* currently debugging.
    #Such function should throw exceptions if:
    #
    #* A prominent global map is unitialized (e.g., ${ZESHY_STYLE_TO_COLORS}).
    #* A prominent global list is unitialized. (Which to use?)
    #* A prominent global string is unitialized (e.g., ${ZESHY_ASCII_TAB}).
    #* A prominent global alias is unitialized (e.g., and()).
    #* A prominent normal alias is unitialized (e.g., return_exit_status()).
    #
    #This is *VERY* critical to effectively and easily catching regressions.
