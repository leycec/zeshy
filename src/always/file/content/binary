#FIXME: It'd be nice to abstract out the load_zsh_module/freeze_variable/unload_zsh_module
#cruft into a helper function -- say, with_mapfile(): e.g.,
#
#    with_mapfile 'print ${${(f)mapfile[${filename}]}[1]}'

    # Load Zsh module "mapfile".
#   load_zsh_module zsh/mapfile

    # Forcibly prevent harmful ${mapfile} and hence filesystem changes.
#   freeze_variable mapfile

    # Print the first line of the file with the passed filename.
#   print ${${(f)mapfile[${filename}]}[1]}

    # Unload "mapfile", for safety.
#   unload_zsh_module zsh/mapfile
#FIXME: Should be renamed to, say, "get_find_command_text_file_filter()", and
#consequently moved -- ideally, into a new "zeshy/file/find".
# bool is_text_file_find_compatible(void)
#
# Return a string which, when passed as argument to a "find" process, filters
# the currently visited filename if the corresponding file is binary. "find"
# itself provides no built-in means of performing such filtering, unfortunately.
