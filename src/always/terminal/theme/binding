# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Zeshy Gwydden Binding, theming interactive key bindings:
#
# * <Alt-p>, search history for commands starting with the current command-line.
# * <Ctrl-r>, search history for commands containing the current command-line.
# * <Esc-h>, display the man page for the command in the current command-line.
# * cd -<Tab>, change to the Nth oldest directory on the directory stack.
# * cd +<Tab>, change to the Nth newest directory on the directory stack.
#
# --------------------( TODO                               )--------------------
# * Untie key bindings from theme selection, perhaps by adding support for a
#   ${ZESHY_KEY_BINDINGS} global in the Zeshy configuration file *AND*
#   separating this file into a new "autoload/if_key_bindings/" directory.
