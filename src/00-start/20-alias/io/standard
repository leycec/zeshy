    'string get_stdin[stdin: string input]'\
    "< \"${ZESHY_STDIN_PATH}\"" <<'/---'
Get all standard input to the current context if such input exists or block
indefinitely and silently until such input is written to such context. Since
such blocking is strongly undesirable, this alias should _always_ be preceded by
tests ensuring such input exists (e.g., is_stdin_readable_sans_blocking(),
die_unless_stdin_readable_sans_blocking()). Due to `zsh` optimization, this
alias behaves as expected even when expanded via command substitution (e.g.,
`$(get_stdin)`).

# Sadly, the only safe means of canonicalizing such path is as below. Replacing
# the first pipeline subcommand with a call to canonicalize_path() uselessly
# returns "/dev/fd/0" without resolving such path. Likewise, replacing the
# second pipeline subcommand with a process substitution has the same effect.
# While such results are odd, their underlying reasons are simple: in both
# cases, zsh performs such canonicalization in a subshell attached to a
# different standard input file descriptor. Mercifully, zsh appears to perform
# pipeline subcommands consisting of only low-level builtin print() and history
# modifier "(:A)" in the current shell, ensuring as expected that the standard
# input file descriptor for the current shell is canonicalized.
#
# Since such feature is obscurely undocumented, this could change at any
# time. If it does, another (perhaps more reliable) method remains:
# coprocesses. In theory, we could redirect the result of such output to the
# identity coprocess and then copy such result from such coprocess into such
# variable. In fact, this is precisely how we currently capture standard
# output and error from commands evaluated by the current shell.
