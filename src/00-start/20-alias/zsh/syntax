:parcel <<'/---'
Handle *syntactic aliases* (i.e., aliases simulating `zeshy`-specific syntax
additions to the core `zsh` language).
/---

#FIXME: Actually use such alias elsewhere.
#FIXME: Add examples.

:alias_command ':void :unless()' 'if !' <<'/---'
Unless all subsequent tests succeed (i.e., if all such tests fail), execute the
subsequent code block.

# ....................{ CASE                               }....................
#FIXME: Define two comparable aliases:
#
#* :case.next(), expanding to ";&". Such syntax prompts zsh to continue to the
#  next case. Since this is the default action, such syntax is merely syntax
#  sugar. (That said, there probably should have been *NO* default action.
#  Explicitly specifying such syntax is vastly preferable.)
#* :case.continue(), expanding to ";|". Such syntax prompts zsh to continue
#  scanning for any other cases matching the same string. Pretty sweet!

:alias_command ':void :case.break()' ';;' <<'/---'
Break from the current `case` statement (i.e., immediately terminate such
statement). Expand this alias _only_ as the last command in `case` statement
conditions: e.g.,

.:case.break()

#FUXME: Rename to :case.break(), which is considerably more evocative of what
#such alias accomplishes. (Also, we prefer "stop" to "end" in zeshy
#nomenclature. Using "stop" here, however, would imply such alias to
#syntactically terminate the entire case() block, which isn't the case.)

#     'void :for_string(string string_name, string code1, ...)'\

#         :string string_name__fs; string_name__fs="$(:stdin.get)"

# Terminate the current `case` statement. Expand this alias _only_ in `case`
# statement conditions, typically as the last command in such conditions: e.g.,
# /---

#Break from the currently matched condition of the current `case` statement. This
#is typically the last command in every such condition of most : e.g.,

# *`zsh` subshell* (i.e., child shells forked from other shells, typically
# using `(...)` and `$(...)` syntax) aliases.
