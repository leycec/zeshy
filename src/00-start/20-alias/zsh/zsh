Report success if the current shell is a *subshell* (i.e., a child `zsh` shell
forked from another `zsh` shell, typically via `(...)` or `$(...)` syntax).

:alias_simple.declare ':void :break_case()' ';;' <<'/---'
Terminate the current `case` statement. Expand this alias _only_ in `case`
statement conditions, typically as the last command in such conditions: e.g.,

.:break_case()

#FUXME: Rename to :break_case(), which is considerably more evocative of what
#such alias accomplishes. (Also, we prefer "stop" to "end" in zeshy
#nomenclature. Using "stop" here, however, would imply such alias to
#syntactically terminate the entire case() block, which isn't the case.)

#Break from the currently matched condition of the current `case` statement. This

# using `(...)` and `$(...)` syntax) aliases.
