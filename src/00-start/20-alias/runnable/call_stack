:parcel <<'/---'
Handle call stack aliases. The call stack is the list of all *runnables* (i.e.,
called `zsh` functions, sourced `zsh` scripts, and evaluated eval() statements)
on the call path to the current runnable from the initial runnable originating
such runnable -- typically, the runnable called directly by the current user
from the CLI.

# Avoid calling functions in alias expansions to avoid polluting the call stack.

        }
    } <<<' <<'/---'
Throw an exception with a stock message unless the passed integer is a valid
index of the current call stack. See is_call_stack_index() for further details.

    '[status = :bool] is_call_stack_contains(:string runnable_name)'\
    '(( ${funcstack[(ie)${1}]} <= ${#funcstack} ))' <<'/---'
Report success if the current call stack contains the passed *runnable* (e.g.,
`zsh` function or script). Equivalently, return success if such runnable is
either the current runnable or transitively called such runnable.

           (-${#funcstack} <= index__icsi && index__icsi <= -1) ))
    } <<<' <<'/---'
Report success if the passed integer is a valid 1-based positive or negative
index into the current call stack.

    '[status = :bool] is_call_stack_index_script(:int index)'\
    '{

        die_unless_call_stack_index "${index__icsis}"
    #   print "function: ${1}\nfuncstack: ${funcstack[*]}"

        # Test such index.
        is_call_stack_item_script "${funcsourcetrace[${index__icsis}]}"
    } <<<' <<'/---'
Report success if the runnable at the passed 1-based positive or index index
into the current call stack was a sourced `zsh` script (i.e., was _not_ a called
`zsh` function or evaluated eval() statement).

== Caveats ==

*While reliable, this alias is _not_ infallible.* Unfortunately, `zsh` currently
offers no general-purpose means of differentiating files from non-files in the
call stack. The reasonably reliable heuristic this alias implements is as follows:
/---

# ....................{ GETTERS                            }....................
#FIXME: Refactor into a setter.
:alias_command ':int get_call_stack_size()'\
    ':string.output $(( ${#funcstack} ))' <<'/---'
Get the size of the current call stack.

        # Unfortunately, there 
        #
        # If such runnable was a sourced file, the corresponding

#FUXME: Convert to aliases. As functions, the implicit risk of such calls

#is_call_stack_index_script() is of course a function), which is silly.

#   :string.output 

    #FUXME: Insufficient. Function names can contain path separators, but this
    #function should only reduce a runnable name to its basename if such
    #runnable signifies a script rather than function. To discriminate between
    #the two, see output_call_stack_with_lists() -- necessarily implementing
    #similar logic.

#FUXME: Rename to is_call_stack_runnable().
    # If the call stack is nonempty, return the first runnable on such stack;
    # else, return "zeshy". (The latter should *NEVER* trigger, but is provided
    # as a failsafe backup.)

    #FUXME: Poor implementation. 
#   command basename -- "$(get_call_stack_root)"
#FUXME: Rename to is_call_stack_runnable().
