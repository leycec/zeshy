declare_parcel_as_script_with_stdin <<'/---'
Handle *standard file descriptor* (i.e., standard input, output, and error)
constants.

declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_BIT_BUCKET_PATH='/dev/null' <<'/---'
Absolute path of the *null device file* (e.g., `/dev/stdin`), colloquially
referred to in Unix jargon as the ``bit bucket''.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_STDIN_PATH='/dev/stdin' <<'/---'
Absolute path of the device file associated with standard input (i.e.,
`/dev/stdin`). Since both this and ${ZESHY_STDIN_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_PATH} are
usually symbolic links to such file, consider calling get_stdin_path() for the
absolute path of the actual file such links point to (e.g., `/dev/pts/6`).
/---

declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_STDOUT_PATH='/dev/stdout' <<'/---'
Absolute path of the device file associated with standard output (i.e.,
`/dev/stdout`). Since both this and ${ZESHY_STDOUT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_PATH} are
usually symbolic links to such file, consider calling get_stdout_path() for the
absolute path of the actual file such links point to (e.g., `/dev/pts/9`).
/---

declare_global_with_stdin string ZESHY_STDERR_PATH='/dev/stderr' <<'/---'
Absolute path of the device file associated with standard error (i.e.,
`/dev/stderr`). Since both this and ${ZESHY_STDERR_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_PATH} are
usually symbolic links to such file, consider calling get_stderr_path() for the
absolute path of the actual file such links point to (e.g., `/dev/pts/7`).

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STDIN_FILE_DESCRIPTOR=0 <<'/---'
Canonical file descriptor for standard input (i.e., 0).
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STDOUT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR=1 <<'/---'
Canonical file descriptor for standard output (i.e., 1).
/---

declare_global_with_stdin integer ZESHY_STDERR_FILE_DESCRIPTOR=2 <<'/---'
Canonical file descriptor for standard error (i.e., 2).

declare_global_with_stdin string\
    ZESHY_STDIN_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_PATH="/dev/fd/${ZESHY_STDIN_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}" <<'/---'
Absolute path of the canonical file descriptor-specific device file for standard
input (i.e., `/dev/fd/0`). See ${ZESHY_STDIN_PATH} for a similar path, typically
but _not_ necessarily symbolically linked to the same path.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin string\
    ZESHY_STDOUT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_PATH="/dev/fd/${ZESHY_STDOUT_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}" <<'/---'
Absolute path of the canonical file descriptor-specific device file for standard
output (i.e., `/dev/fd/1`). See ${ZESHY_STDOUT_PATH} for a similar path,
typically but _not_ necessarily symbolically linked to the same path.
/---

declare_global_with_stdin string\
    ZESHY_STDERR_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_PATH="/dev/fd/${ZESHY_STDERR_FILE_DESCRIPTOR}" <<'/---'
Absolute path of the canonical file descriptor-specific device file for standard
error (i.e., `/dev/fd/2`). See ${ZESHY_STDERR_PATH} for a similar path,
typically but _not_ necessarily symbolically linked to the same path.
