void :define_alias_split(
    string alias_name,
    string args_list_name,
    string alias_expansion)

Define the passed *split alias* (i.e., alias split into one prefixing simple
alias defining a local list with the passed name containing all arguments
passed to such alias _and_ one suffixing global alias expanding to the passed
expansion presumably operating on such arguments). For clarity, this function
implicitly suffixes such alias name by `::` _and_ requires the last argument
passed to such alias also be `::`. If such alias has already been declared, an
exception is thrown: e.g.,

== Motivation ==

By design, *non-suffix aliases* (i.e., simple and global aliases) cannot accept
or operate on passed arguments. At function and script definition time, `zsh`
unconditionally replaces all such aliases in-place by their corresponding
*expansions* (i.e., raw strings providing no function-like calling conventions
and hence no means of accepting or operating on passed arguments).

[[define_alias_split.circumvention]]
=== Constraints Unloosened ===

Such constraints are readily circumventable for non-suffix aliases either:

1. *Terminating with the name of an existing runnable* (e.g., alias, builtin,
   command, function). In such case, all arguments passed to such aliases will
   (after alias expansion) be passed to such runnables instead. Hence, such
   aliases neither accept or operate on such arguments -- they only simulate the
   act of doing so. Such runnables are typically functions designed explicitly
   for and hence intended to be called _only_ by such aliases: e.g.,
+
.:define_alias_split() Terminating-name Alternative
==========================================
[source]
------------------------------------------
>>> function ::set_string_to_arg_2() {
...     die_unless_args_2_or_more\
...         'Expected one string name and one or more strings.'
...     :set_string_to_string "${1}" "${3}"
... }
>>> alias :localize_arg_2='
...     :string arg_2
...     ::set_string_to_arg_2 arg_2'
>>> :localize_arg_2\
...    "No one is going to give you the education you need to overthrow them."
...    "Nobody is going to teach you your true history, teach you your true"
...    "heroes, if they know that that knowledge will help set you free."
>>> output_string "${arg_2}"
Nobody is going to teach you your true history, teach you your true
------------------------------------------
==========================================
1. *Accepting and operating on only one argument.* Such aliases are best
   defined as expanding to one `{`- and `}`-delimited block of code accepting
   such argument as a `<<<`-prefixed here-string from standard input: e.g.,
+
.:define_alias_split() Single-argument Alternative
==========================================
[source]
------------------------------------------
>>> alias :output_string_line_first='{ get_string_line "$(get_stdin)" 1 } <<<'
>>> :output_string_line_first\

...     we have to destroy the present politico-economic system."
The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That's why
------------------------------------------
==========================================

=== Constraints Unchained ===

In either case, such aliases are trivially implemented and hence necessitate no
additional help from `zeshy`. However, what of aliases both accepting _and_
operating on two or more passed arguments? Are such aliases trivially
implementable -- or even implementable at all?

As the existence and definition of this function can attest:

* *Yes,* aliases both accepting _and_ operating on two or more passed arguments
  _are_ implementable.
* *No*, such aliases are _not_ trivially implementable. (It took us roughly
  two years to formulate the answer that eventually evolved into this function.
  Presumably, you could have done better.)

== Usage ==

*Consider calling this function _only_ for defining aliases necessarily
accepting _and_ operating on two or more passed arguments.* All aliases defined
by this function impose `zeshy`-specific calling conventions (e.g., requiring
callers _always_ pass `::` as the last alias argument) and non-negligible
internal inefficiencies (e.g., list assignments, eval() calls). As
<<define_alias_split.circumvention,previously demonstrated>>, aliases either
terminating with the name of an existing runnable _or_ accepting and operating
on only one passed argument suffer no such issues.

== Implementation ==

This function defines the passed alias to:

* Define string local ${zeshy_alias_split_expansion__} to:
** Undefine itself.
** Run the passed expansion, presumably expanding the passed list to access
   arguments passed to such alias.
* Locally define the passed list to all arguments passed to such alias.

#FIXME: Woops! We can't use a string local-based approach here, as eval() only
#succeeds on complete code (whereas here we would typically attempt to e eval()
#an incomplete code fragment containing a prefixing "{" but no suffixing "}").
#Hence, we have to defer back to an alias-based approach.
#FIXME: Wait. That doesn't work either. Contemplete either using a
#here-document or anonymous function. (One or the other *SHOULD* work.)
#FIXME: The only issue with the anonymous function approach is when embedded in
#nested iteration and/or conditionals. Is zsh actually robust enough to
#tolerate that sort of mayhem?
#FIXME: O.K.; the implementation's become a bit... eccentric. Should work, but
#*JEEBUS* is that some wicked complexity. We probably don't want to trudge any
#further down this road. (Wow. Just... wow.)
#FIXME: O.K.; it was a modest try, but it's evident that the approach of the
#prior function simply doesn't scale to this case. However, this function *IS*
#still implementably by defining aliases resembling: 
#
#     :sise humdo lumro stimly :sise{
#        print "${arg__s}: ${(P)arg__s}"
#    }:sise
#
#Hence, we need to define *THREE* such aliases. (No, we *CANNOT* define
#":sise}" instead of "}:sise". Yes, we tried.)
#
#Clearly, ":sise{" is the linchpin. Rather than have such alias expand a string
#local, such alias should simply expand to the passed start expansion and
#"}:sise" expand to the passed stop expansion. It's so simple, we're fairly
#embarassed we didn't concoct it earlier. *sigh*

#FIXME: Improve documentation. Specifically, document the motivation for this
#function: namely, effectively adding new syntactic block constructs (e.g.,
#conditionals, iterators) to the zsh language.
