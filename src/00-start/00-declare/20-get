# Define getters *BEFORE* the first call to :func.document() below. Such can
# transitively call ::parcel.get_preposition() (e.g., under error conditions),
# requiring we define such getter before the first call to :func.document().
# (Awkward, but certainly not indefatiguable.)
#
# While getters are typically undesirable (e.g., due to inefficiency concerns),
# the getters defined below are intended to be called *ONLY* for throwing
# human-readable exceptions -- in which case, efficiency is largely irrelevant.

# :string ::parcel.get_preposition()

    (( ! # )) || :die 'Expected no arguments.'
