Terminate the current function declaration, documenting such function with the
passed AsciiDoc-formatted help string. Specifically:

* Prefix such function's body by autogenerated code defaulting, localizing,
  and/or validating such function's arguments. This function generates such
  code by iteratively parsing every argument in the argument list specified by
  such function's prototype, previously declared by :func_().

    #FIXME: We declare *ALOT* of locals here, thus allocating and deallocating
    #storage for all such locals on each function declaration. Arguably, such
    #locals would be better defined in @{compile} and then forcefully reset
    #here, a substantially faster operation than such large-scale reallocation.
    #This has a number of immediate beneficial side effects, including:
    #
    #* ${code_prefix} need no longer be declared as a global -- and, in fact,
    #  would require no refactoring whatsoever.
    #* In truth, we shouldn't even need to reset any such locals here. Why?
    #  Because *WE ALREADY DO SO* on each argument count iteration. Nice!
    #  * After examination, the only locals definitively requiring
    #    reinitialization are:
    #
    #    args_is_string_glob=0
    #    args_is_unlocalized=0
    #
    #* While reallocating scalar variables probably isn't terribly costing,
    #  reallocating the following three non-scalar maps almost certainly is.
    #  Avoiding such reallocation alone makes the effort worthwhile.
    #
    #That said, when we do so, we'll need to rename all such locals into
    #pseudo-globals: e.g., from
    #${arg_declarer_to_declarations} to
    #${ZESHY_FUNC_ARG_DECLARER_TO_DECLARATIONS__}. In short, prefix each local
    #name by "ZESHY_FUNC_" and suffix by "__".
    #FIXME: Indeed, the prior discussion applies equally well to the globals
    #declared below. Convert all such globals to similar locals; all told, this
    #should *DRAMATICALLY* reduce nonscalar variable reallocations, which is
    #(probably!) exceptionally critical to obtaining tolerable performance.

    # Parse the minimum and maximum number of arguments such function accepts
    # *BEFORE* parsing such arguments. All reasonably sane implementations of
    # argument parsing require such numbers (e.g., to reliably index and expand
    # optional and variadic arguments and arguments following such arguments).
    #
    # Superficially, this appears to necessitate two parse passes over the
    # argument list: the first pass obtaining such numbers and the second pass
    # actually parsing such arguments. In practice, however, careful choices in
    # runnable prototype syntax reduce the first pass to efficient string
    # munging operations requiring *NO* explicit iteration. Indeed, note that:
    #
    # * Omitting single- and double-quoted strings, each "," in an argument
    #   list suggests such function to accept one more mandatory argument.
    # * Omitting single- and double-quoted strings, each "?" and "=" in an
    #   argument list suggests such function to accept one more optional
    #   argument.
    # * Each mandatory argument increases the maximum number of arguments such
    #   function accepts by one.
    # * Each optional argument reduces the minimum number of arguments such
    #   function accepts by one.
    #
    # Efficiently determining such numbers thus reduces to counting the number
    # of unquoted ",", "?", and "=" characters in such argument list.
    #
    # Unfortunately, while such determination *IS* demonstrably efficient,
    # conforming to the algorithm implemented below requires reparsing the
    # argument list once for each optional (but *NOT* variadic) argument such
    # function accepts. (Why? Because each additional optional argument implies
    # such function to accept one additional possible number of arguments and
    # each such number necessitates distinct code validation and hence
    # algorithmic handling here.)
    #
    # Unfortunately, eliminating such reparsing would require persisting a list
    # of argument metadata during the first and only pass for subsequent lookup
    # (as detailed below), itself imposing non-negligible inefficiencies. The
    # question then reduces to: which is less efficient, reparsing each
    # argument multiple times or parsing such arguments into a list only once?
    #
    # To answer this question, consider the common case. If most or even many
    # zeshy functions accepted optional arguments and hence required such
    # reparsing, such reparsing would indeed be non-ideal. In practice, few
    # zeshy functions accept optional arguments (due to readability and
    # writability concerns associated with such arguments). Since the common
    # case imposes no argument reparsing, reparsing poses no imposition.
    #
    # Note that the above two parse passes are technically invertable by
    # parsing all arguments into a list of all argument in the first pass and
    # iterating over such list in the second. In practice, the infrastructure
    # required by such iteration imposes significant space and time costs.
    #
    # For example, consider the following "inverted" implementation:
    #
    #    local -a args_metadata

    #   correspond to the line number of the listed function or script's
    #   pre-parsed definition on which the "next" function or script in the
    #   call stack was called.

    #   such function derives from a digest file, as all zeshy functions do.
    # * The prior observations directly imply that the definitions of functions
    #   defined by this function (but *NOT* by builtin function()) may be
    #   correlated with line numbers: both the current line number and the line
    #   numbers recorded on the call stack (e.g., due to thrown exceptions).
    # * The prior implication itself implies that functions defined by this

            #             #FUXME: Actually, since this is more general than our

            #             #reason we can't use this approach to default *ALL*

            #             #also variadic. Although the resulting logic will not
            #             #be quite as efficient, default arguments should only
            #             #ever be used in cases where efficiency doesn't
            #             #terribly matter anyway (e.g., front-facing CLI
            #             #aliases). The tangible benefits in both generality and
            #             #simplicity make this a more than worthwhile tradeoff.
            #             #FUXME: So. The current approach *DOES* appear to
            #             #generalize pleasantly, but also produces overly
            #             #verbose and inefficient code for functions accepting
            #             #two or more defaultable arguments. Which is mildly
            #             #disconcerting. Clearly, we need some means of
            #             #compacting multiple assignments together. For example:
            #             #
            #             #* If the first argument is defaultable and unpassed
            #             #  *AND* there exist any other defaultable, unpassed
            #             #  arguments, then since we have to replace the entire
            #             #  argument list anyway, we'd might as well compact the
            #             #  second default value assignment into the first:
            #             #  e.g.,
            #             #
            #             #    # For a function with prototype:
            #             #    # :void :yum(
            #             #    #     :string x = 'yay',
            #             #    #     :int j, :int k, :int l,
            #             #    #     :string y = 'yay',
            #             #    #     :int a, :int b, :int c)
            #             #    # ...we might want a preamble containing:
            #             #    if (( # == 6 )) {
            #             #        code_args_local_or_valid+='argv=( '${arg_default_value_x}' "${@[1,3]}" "${arg_default_value_y}" "${@[4,6]}" )'
            #             #    } elif (( # == 7 )) {
            #             #        code_args_local_or_valid+='argv[4]+="${arg_default_value_y}"
            #             #    }
            #             #
            #             #Brutal. There's clearly a way to identify and handle
            #             #such cases; now, we just have to doctor it up.
            #             #FUXME: O.K.; to reasonably implement this, we'll want
            #             #a new string local ${code_args_default} to which we
            #             #append here rather than to ${code_args_local_or_valid}.
            #             #Ensure that we:
            #             #
            #             #* Reset 'code_args_default=' each loop iteration.
            #             #* Test '[[ -n "${code_args_default}" ]]' far below; if
            #             #  such test succeeds, then and only then append
            #             #  ${code_args_local_or_valid} by ${code_args_default}.
            #             #  As the above example demonstrates, we test for the
            #             #  current argument count exactly. We do *NOT* need an
            #             #  "else" branch (indeed, that would be quite
            #             #  counterproductive); we do, however, need to track
            #             #  whether this is the first such branch. Fortunately,
            #             #  the latter is trivial by simply noting whether or
            #             #  not '[[ -n "${code_args_default}" ]]'.
            #             #* Moreover, *ALL* such branches must clearly be
            #             #  emitted before subsequent logic. This suggests,
            #             #  clearly, that we actually need *TWO* new string
            #             #  locals:
            #             #  * ${code_args_default_current}, containing only the
            #             #    set of all "argv"-specific commands for the
            #             #    current argument count. Reset such string each
            #             #    loop iteration.
            #             #  * ${code_args_default}, containing *ALL* such
            #             #    default value-specific logic. Do *NOT* reset such
            #             #    string each loop iteration. Expand such string
            #             #    into ${func_preamble} at the end of this function.

        #FUXME: The current test is insufficient. Specifically, this:

        #...should also include a test of "+ ${#code_args_local_variadic}" or
        #some such. *yawn morosely*

    #FUXME: Actually, stripping a prefixing newline should no longer be
    #necessary; we now ensure ${code_args_default} *NEVER* begins with such a
    #newline, and should make similar changes above to ensure ${code_arg_count}
    #only begins with a newline when preceded by a nonempty
    #${code_args_default}. The simplest means of effecting this is probably to:
    #
    #* *ALWAYS* suffix ${code_args_default} by a newline.
    #* *NEVER* prefix ${code_args_count} by a newline -- just by indentation.

    # # String expanded at the start of such function's body, thus localizing and
    # # validing arguments *BEFORE* all user-defined logic.
    # #
    # # Strip a prefixing newline from such preamble, if any. While it would
    # # clearly be preferable to avoid emitting such newline in the first place,
    # # such newline has two possible sources (either ${code_args_default} or
    # # ${code_arg_count}, depending on whether at least one unpassed argument is
    # # defaulted) and hence is non-trivially removable. This is much simpler.

                        #FUXME: Actually, the approach pursued below should
                        #*ALSO* suffice in this case as well. Hence, we want to
                        #implement such approach if either:

                    #FUXME: Silly. Since we now know beforehand whether there
                    #exists an optional argument, this is removable; instead,

            # # Else, such argument is validly variadic.

 # Alternatively, since it's clear this is only an
        #optimization concern and a mild one at that, we should probably simply
        #excise such conditional.
            #FUXME: Due to the "! arg_is_variadic" constraint below, this is
            #probably shiftable into the prior conditional, no?
            #FUXME: Actually, even this condition isn't *QUITE* sufficient. We
            #also want to avoid localizing unpassed absentable arguments, for
            #obvious reasons (e.g., to ensure unpassed arguments are
            #distinguishable from the empty string, 0, and 0.0). This probably
            #ties into our currently erroneous use of "continue" above; oh,
            #right. In the above case, we simply coerce "arg_is_localized=0",
            #suggesting we should probably do the same (for both orthogonality
            #and consistency) when "(( arg_is_variadic ))".

                        #FUXME: And another subtle point: after implementing
                        #such conditional logic, the size of the current
                        #argument list is increased by 1 for each defaulted
                        #argument, implying that the ${code_args_local_or_valid}-
                        #based conditional below will be testing the wrong
                        #argument count. Happily, this is easily correctable by
                        #maintaining a new argument count incremented by 1 here
                        #for each defaulted argument:
                        #
                        #    integer arg_count_after_default

                        #FUXME: The right idea; however, we need to be doing
                        #just the *OPPOSITE*. If the current argument is both
                        #unpassed *AND* undefaulted (which can occur due to any
                        #number of root causes, such as being absentable *OR*
                        #being relaxedly defaultable), we need to:
                        # arg_count_after_default-=1

            # For each alias name and corresponding string localizing arguments
            # into locals declared by expanding such alias, do so *BEFORE*
            # assigning unpassed defaultable arguments default values.
            #
            # Naturally, the reasons why are somewhat subtle. Technically, such
            # declarations and assignments *COULD* be combined. For example:
            #
            #     # Rather than separating such statements like so...
            #     :string mu="${1}" wu="${2}" nothing something
            #     nothing="Nothing lasts but nothing is lost."
            #     something="$(false)"
            #
            #     # ...we could simply combine such statements.
            #     :string\
            #         mu="${1}"\
            #         wu="${2}"\
            #         nothing="Nothing lasts but nothing is lost."\
            #         something="$(false)"
            #
            # When *NOT* preceded by a declaration, assigning a variable a
            # string embedding at least one process substitution reporting
            # failure (e.g., 'something="$(false)"') itself reports failure and
            # hence implicitly throws an exception. This is good.
            #
            # When preceded by a declaration, however, such assignment *ALWAYS*
            # reports success and hence ignores such failure. This is bad.
            #
            # Separating declarations and assignments thus preserves essential
            # errors, reducing the former to simple string assignments *ALWAYS*
            # succeeding and hence requiring no exception handling (e.g.,
            # 'my_var="${1}"').
            #
            # For efficiency, iterate only by keys (rather than by both keys
            # and values).

            #FUXME: Excise. See above.

            # subsequent iteration validates such arguments.

                        #FUXME: Actually, only do this if we're also localizing
                        #such argument. If we're *NOT*, we have no choice but
                        #to treat such assignment as if relaxed.
                        #FUXME: Oh, yes -- and we clearly need to handle
                        #relaxation as well.

                        #this won't be terribly difficult to support at all.
                        #Specifically:
                        #
                        #* If such defaultable argument is also variadic,
                        #  prepend ${code_args_local_or_valid} with an
                        #  additional if conditional (probably with only a
                        #  single branch) testing whether such argument was
                        #  passed or not.
                        #* If unpassed, the body of such conditional should
                        #  directly modify the argument list to interpose such
                        #  argument's default value directly into the current
                        #  argument list as follows:

                        #       certainly worth a lucky try. Yes, it does!
                        #       Huzzah: e.g.,

                        #    2. Inject such default value into the proper
                        #       index: e.g.,
                        #       argv[${arg_index}]="${arg_default_value}"
                        #    Actually, given such operations, we *CAN* combine
                        #    them into the following single efficient command:
                        #
                        #    argv[$(( arg_index - 1 ))]+="${arg_default_value}"
                        #
                        #    Wait! That works for all indices except the first,
                        #    of course, which requires an inefficient but still
                        #    compact single command: e.g.,
                        #
                        #    argv=( "${arg_default_value}" "${@}" )
                        #
                        #In the above examples, note that ${arg_index} has
                        #probably already been decremented by 1 and hence
                        #incorrect. Handle this... erhm, "appropriately": e.g.,
                        #    argv[${arg_index}]+="${arg_default_value}"

                        #FUXME: While such code does appear to work here, would
                        #it not be more logically consistent to shift it below
                        #where we append to ${code_args_local_or_valid}
                        #en-masse? Hmm; certainly not, as we require the index
                        #of such argument. Note this below.

                            # If such argument is the last standard argument
                            # such function accepts (ignoring all subsequent
                            # optional variadic list arguments, of course), 

                    #FUXME: Unlike all other instances of relaxation, 

                #FUXME: Uh oh. Such conditionals appear to suffice in all cases
                #*EXCEPT* where variadic arguments are passed, in which case...
                #what? Do we perhaps need to shift such "==" comparisons below
                #to ">=" instead? Contemplate.

# In such case, test for implying at least one optional argument to be
                # tested for.
            #FUXME: Slightly more efficient to initialize such index to 1 above
            #and set this

                        # impose ineffectual complexities.
            # If localizing such argument (i.e., if such argument name is
            # unrelaxed), do so.
            # if [[ -z "${match[${ZESHY_RUNNABLE_ARG_MATCH_INDEX_NAME_IS_RELAXED}]}" ]] {

    #FUXME: How do variadic arguments semantically interact with default
    #values? Not terribly well, one should think. Perhaps forbid such
    #combination with a thrown exception, for the moment?
