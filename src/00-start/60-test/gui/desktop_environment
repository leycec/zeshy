declare_parcel_as_script_with_stdin <<'/---'
Handle *display environment testers* (i.e., high-level functions testing whether
the current display environment either is a particular such environment _or_
belongs to a particular category of such environments).

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_desktop_environment(void)

Report success if the current windowing system provides a *desktop environment*
(i.e., the third-party component of such system implementing the traditional
desktop metaphor, which reinterprets the computer display as a physical desktop
of movable objects such as documents and document folders).
/---

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_desktop_environment_kde(void)

Report success if the current desktop environment is *KDE Plasma Workspaces*
(i.e., the set of all Qt-based graphical environments first introduced by KDE
Software Compilation 4), also referred to as *Plasma* or *Plasma Desktop*.
/---

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_desktop_environment_unity(void)

Report success if the current desktop environment is *Ubuntu Unity* (i.e., the
graphical user interface (GUI) for Ubuntu Linux implementing a document-centric
desktop metaphor, previously developed as a shell interface for the GNOME
desktop environment under the X.Org display server but redeveloped in Unity 8 as
a standalone desktop environment under the Mir display server).

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_desktop_environment_gnome_2(void)

Report success if the current desktop environment is *GNOME 2.x* (i.e., the
GTK+-based GNU Project implementing the traditional desktop metaphor). The most
prominent component of such environment was (arguably) *GNOME Panel*, a
configurable GNOME application launcher and taskbar.
/---

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_desktop_environment_gnome_3_or_newer(void)

Report success if the current desktop environment is *GNOME 3.x or newer* (i.e.,
a GTK+-based GNU Project implementing a document-centric rather than traditional
desktop metaphor). The most prominent component of such environment is
(arguably) *GNOME Shell*, a widget engine and graphical user interface (GUI) for
application launching and window switching.
/---

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_desktop_environment_cinammon(void)

Report success if the current desktop environment is *Cinammon* (i.e., a
GTK+-based desktop enviroment forked from GNOME 3.x but still implementing the
traditional desktop metaphor).
/---

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_desktop_environment_mate(void)

Report success if the current desktop environment is *MATE* (i.e., a GTK+-based
desktop enviroment forked from GNOME 2.x and hence implementing the traditional
desktop metaphor).
/---

# ....................{ TESTERS ~ minimal                  }....................
declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_desktop_environment_lxde(void)

Report success if the current desktop environment is the *Lightweight X11
Desktop Environment (LXDE)* (i.e., an energy-efficient implementation of the
traditional desktop metaphor based on either the GTK+ or Qt graphical toolkits).
/---

declare_function_with_stdin <<'/---'
[status: bool] :is_desktop_environment_xfce(void)

Report success if the current desktop environment is *Xfce* (i.e., a lightweight
implementation of the traditional desktop metaphor based on GTK+).

# 
# Report success if the current desktop environment is *GNOME* (i.e., a GTK+-
# based GNU Project implementing a desktop metaphor), regardless of major version
# and hence including both GNOME 2 and GNOME 3 desktop environments. This does
# _not_ include GNOME forks (e.g., Cinammon, MATE), which typically deviate too
# heavily from their derived codebases to usefully categorize as ``GNOME.''
