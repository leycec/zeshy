#FUXME: We've come to the timely conclusion that we significantly mucked up our
#calling conventions. While the nomenclature below was noble, it's increasingly
#inappropriate for the following reasons:
#
#* Newer zeshy functions predominantly accept a variable name rather than value
#  as their first argument. This is sensible, since most things of interest are
#  retained in variables rather than constructed on-the-fly. While the latter
#  would probably dominate (and do under customary high-level languages), the
#  extreme inefficiency of subshells effectively mandates the passing of
#  variable names rather than values.
#* Moreover, passing variable names rather than values results in much cleaner
#  and more readably terse function calls (e.g.,
#  ":call_function variable_name1 'Hello, yollo!'" versus
#  ":call_function "${variable_name1}" 'Hello, yollo!'").
#* Moreover, it's also inherently safer. While callers *SHOULD* behave in a
#  safe manner by double-quoting variable expansions, there's nothing in the
#  language that mandates this. Indeed, we can be guaranteed that third-party
#  callers will pretty much do so only haphazardly, thus guaranteeing subtle
#  bugs inevitably blamed on us.
#
#In short, zeshy functions should predominantly accept a variable name rather
#than value as their first argument. This includes the functions below.
#However, given such shift, the functions below should be renamed from
#"die_unless_integer" to ":die_unless_string_int" and similarly from
#"is_integer" to ":is_string_int". Then, such functions should be strictly
#passed a *STRING* variable and test such variable's value as such.
#
#This is all *VERY* sensible and increasingly essential, given the large-scale
#change in zeshy's direction. It is, however, unfortunate we didn't adopt this
#direction earlier. *shrug*
#FUXME: Wait-wait-wait. No, no, and no. There are a few reasons why:
#
#* Requiring the caller to explicitly expand variables is *ACTUALLY* a good
#  thing, as it makes explicit what is a variable intended to be modified
#  (unquoted) and what is a variable intended only to be read (quoted).
#* Additionally, list and map contents are untyped strings. This is probably the
#  principal reason. *ANY* function not modifying the passed scalar argument
#  should simply accept an untyped string. That's it. Period.
#
#The rule for deciding whether or not to pass a variable name or value to any
#given function is very simple: does that function modify such variable or not?
#If so, pass its name; otherwise, its value. Since the caller is already
#required to know which of the two it's doing for any given function call, *NO*
#nomenclature changes are required. Yes, that's right. *NO* changes. Thus, it's
#quite sensible to have a function :is_bool_true() accepting a boolean *VALUE*
#and another function :enable_bool() accepting a boolean *NAME*. Again, there is
#*NO* confusion here. The rule is simple. Now continue to follow it.
#
#We'll keep this comment here until it fully sinks in. Do *NOT* go down the road
#of the first FUXME comment above. It's the wrong road. It always was. Follow
#the the rule, and we won't go astray.

#FUXME: Incorrect. *ALL* such functions should die unless the passed integer is
#actually an integer, as only that accords with caller expectations. Note
#interestingly that that also induces correct behavior when called by a
#die_unless_*() function (i.e., an exception is thrown, and in fact a more
#appropriately named exception). See "parity" below for what such
#implementations should resemble.

#FUXME: Rename to convert_integer_to_string_separated_by_commas().
#FUXME: Actually, this should be localized and hence renamed to
#convert_integer_to_string_localized(). Not all locales delimit with commas, as
#we well know. Come to think, this might *ALREADY* be localized in such fashion.
#Research what "awk" actually does with the "'" in "%'d".
    #FUXME: Localize this. Not terribly hard, since zsh module "localeinfo"
    #provides map value "${localeinfo[THOUSEP]}" providing such string.
#       print "${integer}" | awk "{ printf \"%'d\n\", \$1 }"
#   die_unless_arg 'expected one string'
#   is "${1}" == '-'<-> si   # mildly clever optimization
#   string integer_min="${1:-0}" integer_max="${2:-32767}"
#FUXME: Rename "_integer" to "_integer" everywhere.
# ....................{ TESTERS ~ value                    }....................
#FUXME: Bad. Accept string values rather than variable names, as is the standard
#for scalar types. Of course, in that case, we'd might as well just shift all
#"string/integer" functionality here, renaming "string_integer" to simply
#"integer" everywhere. *ACTUALLY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BLOODY BRILLIANT IDEA.*
#Make it so, ensign.

#FUXME: This now strikes me as rather wrong. Lists and maps are a reasonable
#rule to nomenclature rules as they can only be accessed by named; integers,
#floats, and other scalar types however are always accessible by their expanded
#values. Consequently, it strikes me as *MUCH* more intuitive to rename
#die_unless_integer() and is_integer() to :die_unless_var_integer() and
#:is_var_integer(). Then excise the is_integer_*() functions; they're
#superfulous, really. Replace them with calls to similar is_integer_*()
#functions -- *WHICH BY THE WAY SHOULD THEMSELVES BE RENAMED BACK TO
#is_integer_*() BUT STILL OPERATE ON EXPANDED STRING SCALARS* and probably
#consequently shifted back into this component.
#
#O.K.; so, we have two nomenclature styles insofar as variables are concerned:
#
#* Scalar-specific functions accepting typeless scalar values.
#* Non-scalar-specific functions accepting typed variable names.
#
#This is perfectly fine and in fact necessary. But don't confuse the two. Stay
#consistent. Let's fix this up, eh? We should document this design decision
#somewhere -- it's rather core.
#FUXME: Actually, consistency *ABSOLUTELY* takes precedence. Ignore all of the
#above.

# (i.e., constrained to natural numbers and
# negatives of such numbers)
