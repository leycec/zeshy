# This script aggregates all environment variables into one file. Note that many
# distros dis-aggregate such environment variables into separate files under
# "/etc/env.d/", which they then programmatically aggregate into a composite
# "/etc/profile.env" file, which this script then sources. Since this tends to
# make for a rather clumsy and overly abstract means of defining environment
# variables, Zeshy prefers to "simply" clump such variables together, here.
