== Alternatives ==

While PCRE syntax explicitly supports such line matching with PCRE option "-m",
`zsh` glob syntax supports no such option. This function simulates such option
by splitting such string on newline into a temporary list and then performing
such glob on such list elements, a remarkably inefficient matching approach
(particularly for long strings). Happily, there exist two alternatives.

=== PCRE-based Line Matching ===

Consider calling is_string_matches_pcre_multiline() instead with the corresponding
PCRE. Since glob and PCRE patterns are similar in both form and function, this is
arguably the easiest course of action: e.g.,

.is_string_line_matches_glob() vs. is_string_matches_pcre_multiline()
==========================================
[source]
------------------------------------------
>>> is_string_matches_pcre_multiline\
...     "${burnt_norton}" ^.*[Tt]ime.*p(resen|as)t.*$ or
...     :stdout.echo "And all is always now."
And all is always now.
------------------------------------------
==========================================

=== Glob-based Line Matching ===

Consider calling :str.is_^=() instead with the corresponding string-
oriented glob. While non-trivial, converting line- to string-oriented globs is
generally (but _not_ always) feasible -- namely, with the following heuristics:

* Prefix such glob with `((#s)|*${ZY_ASCII_NEWLINE})`, matching either the
  string start or a newline.
* Suffix such glob with `((#e)|${ZY_ASCII_NEWLINE}*)`, matching either the
  string end or a newline.
* Replace all internal instances of `*` with `[^${ZY_ASCII_NEWLINE}]#`,
  matching any substring of zero or more characters other than a newline.
* Replace all internal instances of `?` with `[^${ZY_ASCII_NEWLINE}]`,
  matching any character other than a newline.

Such complexity renders PCRE-based line matching the preferable alternative, in
most cases. For example:

.is_string_line_matches_glob() vs. :str.is_^=()
==========================================
[source]
------------------------------------------
>>> :str.is_^= "${burnt_norton}"\
...     ((#s)|*${ZY_ASCII_NEWLINE})[Tt]ime[^${ZY_ASCII_NEWLINE}]#p(resen|as)t((#e)|${ZY_ASCII_NEWLINE}*) or
...     :stdout.echo "At the still point of the turning world."
At the still point of the turning world.

}:func <<'/---'
Get all lines from the passed string:

* Following the first line matching the first passed glob, including such
  line. If no such line matches, throw an exception.
* Preceding the next line matching the second passed glob, including such
  line. If no such line matches, include all remaining lines, thus emulating
  get_string_lines_from_match_until_end().

#FUXME: Implement get_string_lines_from_match_until_end(). Should be quite
#simple, though I don't believe such function can defer to this one.

#FUXME: This isn't right *AT ALL*. I do believe it's feasible, but it will
#require considerably more effort than we've gone to here. Do *NOT* replace "*"
#characters if prefixed by "\", if embedded in a character class "[...]" (which
#itself is non-trivial to match, if one considers it), or if embedded in a
#single- or double-quoted string. Hence, this requires an at least ad-hoc
#parsing effort. *sigh*
#FUXME: No. If you consider it, this is basically impossible to implement in the
#general case. Consider "?", for example, which would also need be similarly
#replaced. It simply doesn't scale to the general case. Replace with line
#splitting into lists and list matching.
