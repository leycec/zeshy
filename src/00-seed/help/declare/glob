:str.global ZY_HELP_GLOB <<'/---'
Glob matching high-level features in alias, function, and global documentation.

== Match Groups ==

This glob captures the following substrings from such documentation:

* `${match[1]}`, the prototype prefixing such documentation suffixed by a
  *blank line* (i.e., two consecutive newlines, optionally delimited by zero or
  more tab or space characters).
* `${match[2]}`, the non-prototype remainder of such documentation --
  presumably in AsciiDoc format.

This glob attempts to match _no_ low-level syntax in such documentation.
