}:func <<'/---'
Declare one or more functions identified by the passed function prototype,
defined to the passed function body and documented by the help string passed on
standard input (e.g., as a here-document or -string).

If any such function has already been declared or defined, an exception is
thrown.

    :func.die_if   "${func_name}"
    :func.redefine "${func_name}" "${func_body}"
}:func <<'/---'
Define the passed function as the passed *function body* (i.e., such function's
implementation excluding `function ${function_name} () {` prefix and `}`
suffix).

If this function has already been declared, an exception is thrown.

== Motivation ==

This function is principally useful for defining functions with *dynamic
implementations* (i.e., function bodies dynamically synthesized at runtime).

Since `zsh` allows functions with names containing shell-reserved characters to
be defined by double-quoting such names (e.g.,
`function "Fisheye Placebo"() { :stdout.echo "You are free." }`), this
function does _not_ need to be called to define functions with such names.
Interestingly, this differs from the case of defining aliases with such names;
due to undocumented subtleties, ::alias_command.define() should _always_ be
called to define these aliases.

== Examples ==
