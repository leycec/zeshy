*Alias definers* (i.e., functions defining aliases with bodies passed as
arbitrary strings).

Note that functions declaring aliases with bodies passed as arbitrary strings
(e.g., :alias_command(), :alias_word(), :alias_command_filetype()) have already
been defined by zy:*-declare/*-alias.zy.

    :str alias_name :str alias_expansion)' :func{

    # Define this alias.
    :alias_command.redefine "${alias_name}" "${alias_expansion}"
}:func <<'/---'
Define the passed command alias to expand to the passed expansion.

If this alias has already been defined, an exception is thrown.

== Motivation ==

`zsh`\'s otherwise intuitive `=`-delimited syntax for defining aliases requires
explicitly escaping *alias-reserved characters* (e.g., `"`, `=`, whitespace) in
alias names and hence does _not_ constitute a general-purpose solution. As the
prior example demonstrates, this function suffers no such deficiencies.
