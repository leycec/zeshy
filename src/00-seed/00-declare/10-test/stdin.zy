    # Given the criticality and commonality of this test, one would assume there
    # to exist builtins or commands for accomplishing it. One would be wrong.
    # Testing whether such file descriptor and hence input is readable without
    # blocking requires calling the commonly available kernel function select().
    # Ideally, such test would elegantly reduce to the following:
    #
    #     read -t 0 -k 0
    #
    # Dismantled, this is:
    #
    # * "-t 0", testing whether standard input is readable without blocking and
    #   returning immediately if not.
    # * "-k 0", reading 0 bytes from standard input if such input is readable.
    #
    # Unfortunately, "read -t 0 -k 0" always returns failure. This differs from
    # bash, in which "read -t 0 -N 0" conditionally returns success when one
    # expects it to. Hence, this test defers to select() instead.
    #
    # Since zselect() (the zsh select() wrapper) returns failure with exit
    # status 2 when the underlying OS fails to provide a select() function,
    # capture and test such status rather than implicitly returning such status
    # as this function's exit status.
    #
    # Dismantled, this is:
    #
    # * "-r ...", testing standard input's canonical file descriptor for
    #   nonempty readability.
    # * "-t 0", reporting whether input bytes exist in a non-blacking manner
    #   (where "0" signifies 0 hundredths of a second wait time).
    # * "-a ...", setting such list to contain a string resembling either
    #   "-r 0" if standard input is nonempty or "" if standard input is empty.
    #   Since zselect() defaults such list to ${reply} if unpassed *AND* since
    #   such list is commonly used by callers and should *NOT* be overwritten by
    #   such a low-level function as this, explicitly specify such list. Since
    #   this function never references such list, our specifying it here is
    #   simply to avoid overwriting ${reply}. (Frankly, this "unique" choice of
    #   API design is one of the more eclectic that we've ever seen. And we were
    #   proficient in ML... once.)
    #
    # Thus doth another feeble mind break. (O^o)

        # Else, report such status. Technically, zselect() reports 0 if *ANY*
        # passed file descriptor is non-blockably readable and 1 otherwise.
        # Since this function tests only standard input, such status exactly
        # coincides with what the caller expects. (Scoooooore!)
