# Zeshy wget.

# ....................{ URLS                               }....................
#FIXME: This is also implementable via 'curl -sI "${url}"'. Do so.
# string wget_resolve_url(string url)
#
# Transitively resolve the passed URL of all intermediary redirects. For
# example, if "http://dieoff.com" redirected to "http://holoceneextinction.com"
# redirected to "http://raiazome.com", then this function prints the final URL,
# "http://raiazome.com".
wget_resolve_url() {
    die_unless_args_1 'expected exactly one URL'

    # Run "wget" with options:
    #
    # * "-t 1" to prevent retrying, if the first attempt fails.
    # * "--spider" to prevent actual retrieval of page content.
    # * "-O -" to permit redirection to a pipe. 
    #
    # Avoid running under "try" as that currently fails to interpret shell
    # sensitive characters properly (e.g., "&"), and redirect stderr to stdout
    # as *WE HAVE TO* (which seems fairly dumb).

    string wget_output="$(wget --max-redirect=0 --spider --tries=1 -O - "${url}" 2>&1)"

    # The resolved URL from "wget" output.
    string url_resolved

    # If the passed URL does redirect to another URL, print that; otherwise,
    # print the URL as is.
    if url_resolved="$(match_multiline_first_group '^Location: ([^ ]+) ' "${wget_output}")"
