# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# ZeshyInit Main, importing all other initial Zeshy dependencies.

# --------------------( SEE ALSO                           )--------------------
# http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html
#   Detailed description of trap functions.
# http://www.bash2zsh.com/essays/essay1_file_manager.html
#   Concise introduction to suffix aliases, mime types, and file magic.
#
# --------------------( TODO                               )--------------------
# * Uhm; how did I never see this? Zsh supports loop syntax resembling:
#   for d (../**/*) {
#   }
#   No need for cumbersome "for d in (../**/*); do ... done" nonsense. 
# * Use the "vcs_info" Zsh module for displaying VCS-specific metadata in a VCS-
#   agnostic fashion.
# * Incorporate ZSH-lovers fixes, including:
#   * Use suffix aliases.
# * The new trap support obsoletes an astonishing quantity of prior
#   functionality (e.g., try()). Such functionality should be retained (???...
#   perhaps not), but exported out of this component into a new component: say,
#   "zeshy/shell/job".
# * zimport() can profitably be renamed require(). The latter captures the
#   intent and implementation much more succinctly and without the awkward
#   prefixing 'z'.
# * We only call a match_*() function once in this file. It's absurd to maintain
#   such complexity here; offload all match_*() functionality to
#   "zeshy/type/regex" and, if still required here, simply inline. I believe we
#   can use simple glob-style matching, instead.
# * Ultimately, Zeshy should auto-compile the recursive entirety of all Zeshy
#   function definitions into a single so-called "digest" file at, say,
#   "~/.zeshy/digest.zwc". Such a file is autoloadable by:
#       
#       # ...implicitly autoloading such digest.
#       fpath=( "~/.zeshy/digest.zwc" "${fpath[@]}" )
#
#       # ...explicitly autoloading such digest.
#       autoload -Uw "~/.zeshy/digest.zwc"
#
#   I'm unsure if the former supercedes the latter. (Probably not, no.) Both
#   required, perhaps.
#
#   What's nice about this is that such a digest file appears to come prepended
#   with a list of all functions defined by such digest, thus rendering
#   autoloading of digest files terrifically fast. Auto-generating such a digest
#   on any change to any Zeshy file or directory is, unfortunately, not quite so
#   easy. We'll need to write something resembling:
#
#       if is "$(get_path_mtime "~/.zeshy/digest.zwc") equals SOMETHING si; then
#           zcompile "~/.zeshy/digest.zwc" "${ZESHY_HOME}/src/"**/*(.)
#       fi
#
#   However, it's unclear just how aggregating multiple files into one handles
#   initialization code. Clearly, it either doesn't or does but simply lumps all
#   initialization together. Either case is bad. We'll need to rewrite Zeshy to:
#
#   * Perform all non-costly initialization up-front in Zeshy .main or core.
#   * Perform all costly initialization in the functions requiring such
#     initialization as the first line of such functions. You know that grind...

setopt extendedglob      # enable extended globbing (#, ~, ^)
setopt globdots          # ???

# Silently delete non-matching globs rather than raising exceptions. While the
# latter is certainly preferable, Zsh fails both to:
#
# * Signal ZERR and hence call TRAPZERR(), printing a full stack trace.
# * Permit the printed error message to be customized. The error messages Zsh
#   prints are largely unhelpful for non-interactive scripts (e.g.,
#   "zsh: no matches found: Tomoe(:A)"), offering no human-readable context for
#   script debugging or development.
# 
# Hence, we reluctantly disable errors on non-matching globs. Zeshy scripts and
# functions must test for glob failure by testing emptiness: e.g.,
#
#     >>> string glob_match=( "PiKHAL/TiKHAL"(:A) )

# Zsh statically caches the expansion of each prompt definition for quick re-
# use when displaying those prompts. (While marginally faster, the latter is
# remarkably less useful as it requires redefining and exporting a prompt to
# alter the display of that prompt.)

# This enables Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) matching via the "=~"
# test operator, by implicitly loading the "zsh/pcre" module when requested.

# into array elements of "${match[@]}" where the first match is "${match[1]}".
# For additional documentation on the "zsh/pcre" module, see:
# http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html#SEC192

#O.K.; the game plan:
#* Separate each function into a separate file. No symlinks. I know; I know.
#  This is awful. But Zsh is as it is on this score. There's no fixing that.
#* Initialization needs to be centralized into a set of core files. Here's
#  what I'm thinking, now: cleave the "src/" directory into:
#  * "src/root", containing "zprofile", "zlogin", and "zshrc".
#  * "src/main", containing this file, "core", and all other initialization as
#    perhaps another file or two ("globals"? bah!). All global variable
#    declarations need to be shifted here.
#  * "src/auto/generic", containing the bulk of Zeshy as such autoloadable function
#    files. All such functions are safely applicable to all systems.
#  * "src/auto/command", allowing for conditionally autoloaded command-specific
#    function directories (e.g., "src/auto/command/ssh").
# * We need one digest for all of "generic" and one digest for each immediate
#   subdirectory of "src/auto/command", the latter conditionally autoloaded if
#   such command exists.
# * This scheme clearly allows for things like "src/auto/os", should we require
#   it. I'm currently considering trashing that... just assume GNU/Linux, for
#   the moment. (Time!)
# * Hmm; perhaps?:
#   "src/catabolize/".
#   "src/initialize/".
#   "src/bootstrap/".
#   "src/framework/".
#   "src/profile/".
#   "src/context/".
# * Ah; O.K.; how about just:
#   "src/construct/".
#   "src/bootstrap/".
#   "src/autoload/always".
#   "src/autoload/if_installed".
# * Or mayhap:
#   "src/boot/".
#   "src/init/".
#   "src/auto/always".
#   "src/auto/if_installed".
#
#Yes, it's lame. But our hands are really constrained, here.
