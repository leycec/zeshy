# Preprocess zeshy-specific code into zsh-specific code.

#FIXME: O.K.; that's *EXACTLY* what we're going to do, but only as an interim
#solution. The long-term solution, though a bit balls-crazy, is as follows:
#
#* Merge the principal PCRE (i.e., ${ZESHY_CALLABLE_PROTOTYPE_PCRE}) produced
#  by ={*-soil/*-declare/*-pcre} into the principal PCRE produced by ={pcre}.
#* Refactor ={*-soil/*-declare/*-func/func} accordingly. (Actually, any
#  refactoring should be quite minimal, as we already reference match indices
#  by name rather than hard-coded integer).
#
#What's indolently pleasant about this approach is that it avoids all of the
#repetitous PCRE compilation we currently perform. Consider it: on each and
#every function declaration, we currently recompile
#${ZESHY_CALLABLE_PROTOTYPE_PCRE}! This is absolute insanity. Happily, the
#above approach does away with that entirely. It also pushes the limits of
#PCRE-based parsing, but hopefully in a tractable, feasible way.
#
#Only one way to find out whether "libpcre" will actually support a PCRE that
#monstrously complex *AND* whether we can actually reliably debug that PCRE,
#right? So, let's do this.
#FIXME: Or perhaps not? The prior solution appears to work quite well, now.

    # however, would substantially complicate subsequent:
    #
    # * PCRE generation. All "libpcre"-reserved characters in such name would
    #   need to be explicitly escaped.
    # * Code preprocessing. Since macro users would need to explicitly escape
    #   all shell-reserved characters in such name *AND* since there exist
    #   multiple means of escape such characters in zsh (e.g., "\"-prefixed
    #   escapes and single- and double-quoted strings), matching all
    #   permissible uses of such macro would require either:
    #   * Matching all possible means of escape such characters.
    #   * Matching only one such means, requiring macro users to only escape
    #     such characters by such means.
    #   * Matching *NO* such means, requiring macro users to *NEVER* escape
    #     such characters. Since such preprocessing is *NOT* a zsh-compliant
    #     parser, such requirement is implementable. Unfortunately, it also
    #     introduces syntactic non-orthogonalities between the zsh parser and
    #     zeshy preprocessor. In other words, it's highly problematic.

    # The latter is, arguably, the greater concern. While correcting the former

        #The latter is simply ${ZPCRE_OP[(w)2]}; the former is the latter minus
        #the byte length of such match.
        #FUXME: Alternatively, perhaps we should simply copy such match into a
        #string list item of the same list. Since empty standard input is
        #indistinguishable from no standard input, perhaps this is the ideal
        #approach. It certainly seems simpler, if slightly less efficient. (Or

        # to the last character of the last argument passed to such macro.
#FUXME: O.K.; so, implementing a zsh-capable in pure-PCRE is rather difficult
#if not infeasible. For example, consider the complexity of merely
#differentiating the following edge cases:
#
#:func ':void yum()' {
#    print ${:-
#    :func
#    }
#    { print $(:stdin.get) } <<'o''k'
#:func
#o'k
#}
#
#Things get *VERY* tricky, *VERY* rapidly. Note the fact, for example, that
#quoted here-doc words may contain quote escapes that then need to be matched
#as their unescaped equivalents, which isn't really feasible to accomplish with
#simplistic PCRE-based group capturing and back referencing.
#
#So, here's what we're going to do for now (and possibly always): we're going
#to implement a genuine preprocessor in the sense that preprocessing will be a
#distinct phase performed strictly *BEFORE* zsh interpretation. In the above
#examples, such preprocessor would treat all macros ":func" regardless of zsh
#context the same. While non-ideal, there's just no feasible means of
#reimplementing robust zsh parsing with PCRE-based iteration.

#FUXME: Uh-oh! How do we perform nested PCRE-based matching? We need to
#perform iterative PCRE matching here to reliably match macros and, for each
#such macro, call such macro's preprocessor -- which itself could (and at
#least in the case of :func() absolutely will) also perform iterative PCRE
#matching. In a conventional language, this would be no problem. Here, however,
#we have a problem.
#
#While we *COULD* probably mitigate this by performing glob-based iteration
#here instead, globs are unwieldy, inefficient, and ultimately infeasible.
#Consider matching here-documents without back references, for example.
#
#Technically, we could simply call pcre_compile() *AFTER* calling each and
#every macro preprocessor.
#FUXME: O.K.; the solution, clearly, is to split preprocessing into two phases:
#
#1. In the first phase, PCRE-based iteration finds *ALL* macros to be replaced
#   in the second phase. Specifically, for each macro, such iteration appends
#   the byte indices of (in order):
#   * The first character of such macro (e.g., the ":" prefixing such macro).
#   * For each block argument passed to such macro (i.e., "{"- and
#     "}"-delimited block of user-defined code):
#     * The first character of such argument (i.e., such "{" delimiter).
#     * The last character of such argument (i.e., such "}" delimiter).
#   * The last character of such macro (e.g., the "}" suffixing such macro),
#     prefixed by "e". Since the number of block arguments is variable, the
#     second phase needs to differentiate this index from block
#     argument-specific indices. This seems a simple way.
#2. In the second phase, list-based iteration iterates over the previously
#   appended byte indices in *REVERSE* order, ensuring macros appearing later
#   in such code will be replaced before macros appearing earlier. Rather than
#   explicitly reverse such list (which introduces other complications),
#   implicitly reverse such list by ensuring the first item of such list is
#   always the empty string and only appending immediately after such item.
#   Assuming a linked list implementation, this is presumably efficient.

    # Phase 2: call and replace all such macros by their output in such code.

    # If such list size is *NOT* a factor of three, such list does *NOT*
    # consist of byte index triples. In such case, throw an exception. (While
    # this should never be the case, an ounce of prevention...)
    # (( ${#macro_bytes_first_name_last} % 3 == 0 )) || :die
    #     'List ${macro_bytes_first_name_last} size '${#macro_bytes_first_name_last}' indivisible by 3.'

    #FUXME: Ugh. We really need the macro order of both
    #${macro_bytes_first_name_last} and
    #${macro_bytes_arg_block_first_last} to be synchronized, implying we
    #should probably implement such reversal above where we append to the
    #former. (Fairly clear, in hindsight.)

    # For each previously matched macro, match each block argument passed to
    # such macro. The next preprocessor phase replaces such macros by their
    # expansions "in place." To prevent these expansions from invalidating the
    # byte indices of block arguments passed to subsequent macros, the next
    # preprocessor phase must iterate macros in reverse order. To ensure this,
    # iterate such macros in reverse order here.
    # for (( macro_byte=$(( ${#macro_bytes_first_name_last} - 2 ));
    #        macro_byte > 1;
    #        macro_byte+=-3 )) {

    #FUXME: Not quite right. We should note that zsh's inability to nest PCRE
    #compilations is an excrutiating handicap. Basically, we really need to
    #explicitly match a sufficiently large finite number of block arguments --
    #say, 16? (This can always be artificially increased as needed.) The reason
    #why, of course, is that we have no way of efficiently matching individual
    #block macro arguments with the ideal "((?:...)*)" approach permitting a
    #countably infinite number of such arguments. Hmm; actually, we *COULD* do
    #it, and probably should. To do so, however, we'll need a new phase 1.75.
    #
    #In phase 1, simply append the following integers to a list local for each
    #macro match:
    #
    #* The first byte of such macro name.
    #* The last byte of the last argument passed to such macro.
    #
    #Since the current PCRE structure readily provides such bytes, no
    #additional work should be required here.
    #
    #In phase 1.75, we'll need to iteratively find the first and last bytes of
    #each block argument passed to such macro (and append such bytes to yet
    #another list local in a manner also detailed elsewhere).
    #
    #It's hardly ideal, of course, but there is no ideal solution here. This
    #has the benefit of scaling to an arbitrary number of arguments, which is
    #blatantly preferable to the alternative -- even if it does incur minor
    #inefficiencies and code complexities along the way.
    #FUXME: Unfortunately, the above approach is complicated by the current
    #need to match macro-specific indentation prefixing the "}" delimiting such
    #block arguments, clearly infeasible with a single universal PCRE. Given
    #that, it's fairly clear that we either need to:
    #
    #1. Only match a finite number of block arguments at the same time as
    #   macros themselves are matched.
    #2. Match a countably infinite number of block arguments after macros are
    #   matched by matching the former with genuine context-free recursion.
    #
    #Obviously, one of these approaches has a bounded shelf-life and the other
    #does not. Given that, we'd might as well implement it right the first
    #time. (You know what to do.)

    #FUXME: We arguably need an intermediary validation phase -- call it
    #"Phase 1.5", perhaps. This phase's sole purpose is to validate the passed
    #code with respect to preprocessing -- that is, to ensure that all macros
    #present in such code were syntactically valid and hence preprocessed.
    #Naturally, such phase should be optimized away under optimized builds.
    #
    #To support such phase, phase 1 should append the starting byte index of
    #each syntactically valid macro to a new list local -- say,
    #${macro_valid_bytes_start}.
    #
    #In all non-optimized builds, phase 1.5 should then compile
    #${ZESHY__MACRO_NAMES_PCRE} and iterate over all substrings matching such
    #PCRE in such code. For each such match, such iteration should compare the
    #starting byte index of such match with the next list item in
    #${macro_valid_bytes_start}. If the two differ, the current macro must
    #necessarily be syntactically invalid. In such case, throw an exception and
    #immediately terminate preprocessing.
    #
    #Such validation does unavoidably introduce inefficiencies but must
    #nonetheless be performed. Due to the complexities of such PCREs, such
    #validation will be essential even for core debugging.
    #FUXME: Actually, we can combine phases 1 and 1.5 via clever PCRE
    #construction. How? By simply appending an alternative to the main
    #macro-matching PCRE matching syntactically invalid macros as any substring
    #beginning with a valid macro name. By listing such alternative *AFTER* the
    #initial PCRE matching only syntactically valid macros, we effectively
    #guarantee the former to only match invalid macros. (At least, that's the
    #theory.) Well, this puts a brighter spin on validation.

        # Begin searching for block arguments passed to the current macro from
        # the first character following the last character of such macro's name
        # to the last character of the last argument passed to such macro.

    # ${macro_bytes_first_name_last}.

        # If either the byte indices of the last character of such macro and
        # such macro's name are equal, such macro is either a syntactically
        # valid macro accepting no arguments *OR* . the character following the
        # latter
        # is a newline, such macro  *AND*

        #FUXME: We probably also want to append the byte index of the last
        #character of such macro name, to prevent having to match macro names
        #in the next phase as well.

    # For each such match, append the following integers to list local
    # ${macro_bytes_first_name_last}:
    #
    # * The index of the first non-whitespace byte of such macro (e.g., the ":"
    #   prefixing such macro's name).
    # * The index of the last non-whitespace byte of such macro (e.g., the "}"
    #   suffixing such macro's last block argument).

#and
    # last bytes of such macro to a list local
    # Fortunately, locally disabling such option permits all strings (multibyte
    # or not) and hence such substring to be indexed by such byte indices.

    #   * The first two phases *ALWAYS* perform PCRE-based iteration.
    #   * Phase 2 *MAY* perform PCRE-based iteration, conditionally depending
    #     on whether the macros such phase calls do so. (Notably, the :func()
    #     macro does so.)
    #
    # Why? Subtleties! Consider the following causal chain of logic.
    #
    # * Since the first two phases *ALWAYS* perform PCRE-based iteration.
    #   * zsh currently only permits one PCRE to be compiled at a time,
    #     directly implying PCRE-based iteration cannot be nested.
    # * Such phases cannot be combined into a single phase.
