# Define PCREs required by preprocessors.

#FIXME: ${ZESHY_MACRO_PCRE} should be generalized to explicitly match all
#ignorable code containing macro-like syntax (e.g., strings, variable
#expansions) preceding non-ignorable macros. However, this is also fraught with
#issues: for example, we'd actually like to expand macros embedded in process
#substitutions in double-quoted strings and variable expansions but *NOT* in
#all other content in double-quoted strings and variable expansions. Is this
#feasible? Perhaps not. In which case, perhaps the current approach is actually
#a bit more ideal than we first conceived.

    #  backtracked into -- even if that results in a match failure.
    #* By contrast, the former is always backtracked into on subsequent match
    #  failures.

    #We believe we've implicitly designed *ALL* alternation below to not
    #require backtracking. That being said, we really won't know until we get
    #the backtracking-capable version working first and then attempt to
    #optimize into the backtracking-incapable version.

    #
    # Note also that both syntactically valid and invalid constructs should be
    # matched. For example, ${} is a syntactically invalid variable expansion
    # but must still be matched as a variable expansion. This prevents
    # unmatched syntactically invalid constructs from being catastrophically
    # matched as syntactically valid delimiters.

    # correcting such issues:
    #
    #     local pcre_quotes_double='"(?:\\[\\"$`]|[^"$`]|(?&sub)|[^"])*"'
    #
    # Let's pick this apart. In order:
    #
    # 1. "\\[\\"$`]", matching any relevant escaped character, where the
    #    meaning of "relevant" depends on the current syntactic construct.  In
    #    the case of double-quoted strings, these are:
    #    * An escaped backslash, preventing such backslash from escaping the
    #      following character.
    #    * An escaped '"' delimiter, preventing such delimiter from terminating
    #      such match.
    #    * An escaped "$" or "`" character, preventing such character from
    #      initiating a variable expansion, arithmetic substitution, or process
    #      substitution (as matched by the following subroutine call).
    # 2. "[^"$`]", matching any irrelevant character, where the meaning of
    #    "irrelevant" is the inverse of the meaning of "relevant" above
    #    excluding backslashes. Since the prior alternative matched all
    #    relevant escaped characters, all remaining escaped characters and
    #    hence backslashes are irrelevant. Since the last alternative is a
    #    fallback matching all characters excluding '"' delimiters, this
    #    alternative is technically redundant. However, the following
    #    alternative is a PCRE subroutine call -- which, by definition, incurs
    #    non-negligible space and time costs. Since such call should be
    #    performed *ONLY* if necessary, this alternative matches all characters
    #    guaranteed *NOT* to be matched by such call.
    # 3. "(?&sub)", matching any variable expansion, arithmetic substitution,
    #    or process substitution. All such syntactic constructs are recursively
    #    nestable and hence matchable only with subroutine calls. (Since
    #    double-quoted strings are only indirectly recursively nestable, such
    #    call is replacable in this specific case by the contents of the
    #    corresponding PCRE ${pcre_substitutable}. In the general case,
    #    however, subroutine calls are typically required.)
    # 4. "[^"]", a fallback matching any unmatched character *NOT* the
    #    terminating '"' delimiter. Assuming the prior alternatives matched
    #    such syntactic construct correctly, this should be equivalent to
    #    matching any unescaped "$" or "`" character. For robustness, it's
    #    simplest to match any non-delimiter.
    #
    # Syntactic constructs delimited by substrings longer than a single
    # character require negative lookahead to properly match. Since such
    # lookahead is comparatively inefficient, defer such lookahead to the final
    # alternative in the PCRE matching such constructs: e.g.,
    #
    #     # Instead of this...
    #     local pcre_math_substitution_new='\$\(\((?:\\[\\)$`]|(?!\)\))(?:[^)$`]|(?&sub)|.))*\)\)'

    #argument block prefixes and suffixes. (Oh, and here-docs!)
    #FUXME: We're also fairly sure that newlines are *NOT* matched properly. A

    #FUXME: Honestly, when in reality would we *EVER* see adjacent line
    #continuations? While we of course need to match such edge case, explicitly
    #optimizing for it as we do so here strikes us as useless. Supplant all use

    #FUXME: Refactor inefficient negative character classes as follows both
    #here and below, wherever applied:

    #FUXME: Not quite. We need to ignore everything after a comment prefix "#"
    #until the end of the line, as well. Unfortunately, differentiating such
    #prefix from "#" characters embedded in other contents (e.g., variable
    #expansions, unquoted globs) is *HIGHLY* non-trivial.
    #
    #Actually, it shouldn't be. zsh comments should *ALWAYS* unconditionally be
    #detectable by being prefixed by either the start of the line *OR*
    #non-empty horizontal whitespace (assuming strings to be properly matched,
    #anyway). That doesn't appear to be the case for all other uses of "#",
    #which appear to *ALWAYS* be prefixed by something other than what prefixes
    #a comment. Hopefully, there exist no exceptions to such heuristic.
    #
    #Actually, *DO* we need to match comments? Well, yes, technically. Consider
    #the following:
    #
    #    # If we ignore comments, then the " basically causes havoc.
    #    if :is uuugh == u##gh :si { # " uhoh
    #        :macro
    #    }
    #FUXME: The above implies that we need to prevent unquoted "#" characters
    #prefixed by blahblah from being matched into macro argument lists. Such
    #characters *MUST* terminate such lists.

    #FUXME: The above also implies that we *DO* need to ignore double-quoted
    #strings and such as well here, to ensure proper matching of single-quoted
    #strings. Failure to do this *WILL* cause extreme parsing havoc. While this
    #does currently prevent us from embedding macros in process substitutions,
    #it's difficult to conceive of a situation in which we'd want to do so. So,
    #let's do this, execrable though it may be.

    #FUXME: Interesting. We've unrelatedly realized that, since "\"
    #unconditionally escapes the following character, we can reduce all
    #"\\[...]" alternatives to simply ${pcre_char_escaped}, where:
    #    local pcre_char_escaped='\\.'
    #We'll want to make such change everywhere, of course, including above.

    #FUXME: We're fairly sure we match line continuations anywhere where we

    #FUXME: Also omit embedded substitutions. For that reason, rename

    #FUXME: O.K.; so, we mucked this up a bit. For both generality and
    #efficiency, replace *ALL* instances of "\R" (and ideally of "\v" as well,
    #though that naturally doesn't apply to negative character classes) by:
    #
    #* End-of-line assertion "$".
    #* Enable multiline mode with "(?m)" above.

    #FUXME: Slightly erroneous. We make the dangerous assumption in
    #::code.preprocess() that such PCRE matches only ASCII characters. Clearly,
    #however, both "\h" and "\R" match multibyte characters. To correct this
    #discrepancy, we'll want to match only the explicit ASCII characters
    #satisfying horizontal and vertical whitespace requirements in a
    #cross-platform portable manner (think Windows line endings) *AND* replace
    #all instances of "\h" and "\R" below by similar constructs.
    #
    #Unfortunately, "libpcre" documentation notes that:
    #
    #"The choice of newline convention does not affect the interpretation of
    # the \n or \r escape sequences or \R." This implies we'll need to:
    #
    # * Test the OS already detected by ={inspect}.
    # * Define a new string local ${pcre_newline} expanding to the OS-specific
    #   PCRE matching newlines.
    #
    # Annoying, but certainly feasible. For now, the current implementation
    # appears to be basically acceptable.

    #FUXME: A minor issue. If ${ZESHY__MACRO_NAMES} is empty, the resulting
    #PCRE will match in a fairly disastrous manner. Guard against such inept

    #FUXME: Incorrect. We want to ignore preceding newlines prefixed by "\"

    #FUXME: ${pcre_line_continuations_optional} is somewhat inefficient here.

    #FUXME: Honestly, "(?!<<)" seems a bit silly. Ideally, since neither

    #by an embedded PCRE here rather than a subroutine call.

    # local pcre_math_substitution=${pcre_math_substitution_new}'|'${pcre_math_substitution_old}
    #FUXME: For efficiency, combine this with ${pcre_math_substitution_new}.

    #FUXME: Sadly, we're fairly confident we need to back out most subroutine
    #calls below. The reason, of course, is inefficiency. PCRE appears to treat
    #subroutines as genuine boundaries for certain purposes; in particular,
    #PCRE copies all match groups prior to a subroutine call and then restores
    #such groups after such call. Hence, while subroutines are a fantastic
    #means of enabling recursion *AND* isolating match groups, they should be
    #avoided for all other purposes. Since we extensively leverage recursion
    #below, we *DO* need to retain subroutine support -- but only for these
    #specific purposes.

#FUXME: We should probably augment such PCREs to also capture optional here-
#documents and -strings passed to such macros and then pass either sort of
#string to such macro function on standard input as a simple here-string. The
#current approach is rather kludgy, it should be admitted. It's also not
#terribly general; after all, macros should be able to modify their output
#based on whether or not they were passed standard input as well as the exact
#content of that input. (It's only sensible, and not terribly difficult to

    #FUXME: Excise the above? Shift documentation here!

    #into ${pcre_chars_unreserved}, excise such PCRE.

 # (Since this PCRE is principally used to match here
    #FUXME: Minor issue. If the captured here-document word embeds quote
    #escapes (e.g., "ugh\"umu"), we have no sane means of matching the
    #corresponding terminator (e.g., in the prior example, we would need to
    #match 'ugh"umu' rather than the literally captured string). We're inclined
    #to ignore this, at the moment. (Indeed, fixing this may be infeasible!)

    #FUXME: Fairly sure we can simplify this quite a bit. We don't *NEED* to
    #match individual arguments on the initial match of the full macro string.
    #In fact, we're fairly sure we don't *EVER* need to match individual
    #arguments. Hence, we can probably generalize ${pcre_macro_arg_command} above
    #with whitespace as follows:
    #
    #    local pcre_macro_arg_command='(?:'${pcre_word_spaces}'|'${pcre_sans_quotes_spaces}'|'${pcre_quotes_single}'|'${pcre_quotes_double}'|'${pcre_var_expansion}')+'
    #
    #Of course, that immediately suggests we combine ${pcre_word_spaces} and
    #${pcre_sans_quotes_spaces} -- probably by omitting "\s" from the
    #definition of the latter. (In any case, it's all for the morrow!)

    # "$"- or "`"-prefixed embedded substitutable.
    # local pcre_substitutable_embedded='(?=[$`])(?&sub)'

# (?>[$`])

    #FUXME: O.K.; we're not going to be able to substitute this below as is.
    #The reason why is the "[^$]". We're afraid that will need to be extended
    #on a case-by-case basis. After doing so, we'll probably want to excise
    #this local entirely.

    # Any character excluding "$" *OR* a "$"-prefixed substitutable.
    # local pcre_char_or_substitutable='\\$|[^$]|(?&sub)'

    #FUXME: Also match recursively nestable process substitution.

    # While we prefer *NOT* to explicitly
    # match arithmetic substitutions, matching only the latter would match one ")" delimiter
    # in arithmetic substitutions as terminating such substitutions -- which,
    # clearly, is not the case.

    #FUXME: For maintainability, we probably want to use embedded named
    #references everywhere we currently use zsh variable embedding below.

    # Arbitrary string of one or more characters excluding characters reserved
    # for strict zsh argument parsing. This includes:
    #
    # * Dollar signs.
    # * Single and double quotes.
    # * Whitespace.
    # local pcre_sans_quotes_spaces='[^\s''"$]++'

    # local pcre_macro_arg_command='(?:'${pcre_sans_quotes_spaces}'|'${pcre_quotes_single}'|'${pcre_quotes_double}'|'${pcre_var_expansion}')+'

    #FUXME: Interestingly, this must be constructed at runtime, implying this
    #entire anonymous function should be converted into a named function
    #::preprocessor_pcres.make() called on *EACH* call to :macro(). Hmm. For
    #efficiency, perhaps:
    #
    #* :macro() should simply set ${ZESHY_MACRO_PCRE} to the empty string.
    #* :code.preprocess() should call ::preprocessor_pcres.make() if
    #  ${ZESHY_MACRO_PCRE} is the empty string.
    #
    #This permits multiple macros to be defined by a single parcel without
    #triggering multiple redundant PCRE compilations, which seems sensible.
    #FUXME: For usability, define a function ::preprocessor_pcres.clear() in
    #this parcel clearing such PCRE globals.

    # One or more such arguments.
    # Unquoted word in the strict zsh sense, comprising one or more characters
    # excluding whitespace and shell-reserved characters.
    # local pcre_word_unquoted='[^]'

    #FUXME: We *DO* need to match variables as well. Here's why:
    #
    #    >>> print ${:-
    #    ... :func
    #    ... }
    #
    #    :func
    #
    #Yes, that actually works. It's a hell of an edge case, but edge case
    #nonetheless. For robustness, we *MUST* account for all such cases.

    #FUXME: Minor issue. If the captured here-document word embeds quote
    #escapes (e.g., "ugh\"umu"), we have no sane means of matching the
