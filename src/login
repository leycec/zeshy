# Handle login shells (i.e., shells passed a first argument of "-"). Under
# Linux, login shells are typically run:
#
# * After authenticating user login credentials by...
# * A process running command "login" executed by...
# * A process running command "getty" executed by...
# * A process running command "init" executed by...
# * The current kernel.

#FIXME: If compiling zeshy, this component should be sourced if not already
#sourced to ensure such functions are compiled into zeshy. Of course, this gets
#a bit tricky:
#
#* The bottom of this script calls login_zeshy(), which we don't really want to
#  happen when compiling zeshy under non-login shells.
#* When compiling zeshy under login shells, such functions will have already
#  been defined and hence not recognized for compilation. *sigh*

Configure the current shell with sane defaults appropriate for login shells.
If global list ${path} and hence global string ${PATH} is non-empty, either
the current user''s `.zprofile` or system-wide `/etc/zsh/zprofile` script has
already performed such configuration, in which case this function effectively
returns immediately. Else, no prior script has performed such configuration, in
which case this function:

* Sets a default command path (i.e., global list ${path} and string ${PATH}).
* Sets a default file creation mask (i.e., `umask`).
* If `/etc/profile.env` is an existing file, sources such script. (Specific
  to Gentoo Linux-based distributions and derivative friends.)
* If `/etc/profile.d/` is an existing directory, sources all scripts under
  such directory. (Supported by most Linux distributions excluding Debian-
  based distributions, whose
  http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s9.9[justifications]
  are largely antiquated and in any case blatantly superfluous.)
