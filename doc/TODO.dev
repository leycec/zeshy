* Add a "ZESHY_IS_OPTIMIZING" configuration flag, which, when enabled, aliases
  all functions prefixed with die_*_{decimal,integer,string,list,map,variable}*() to ":" (i.e., noop()).
* Add shUnit2-fueled unit tests. See: http://code.google.com/p/shunit2/
* The "Unix Toolbox" contains an astounding compendium of concise one-liners:
