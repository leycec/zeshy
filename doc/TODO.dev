zeshy is an unending work-in-progress. As such, the following remain undone:

* Examine "zshuery", a minimalist zsh framework alternative to oh-my-zsh
  leveraging the jQuery model:
  https://github.com/myfreeweb/zshuery
* Add ctags support, which purportedly supports zsh out-of-the-box:
  http://lxtipsandtricks.blogspot.ca/2009/03/how-to-generate-ctags-and-configure-it.html
* Add a "ZESHY_IS_OPTIMIZING" configuration flag, which, when enabled, aliases
  all functions prefixed with die_*_{decimal,integer,string,list,map,variable}*() to ":" (i.e., noop()).
* Add shUnit2-fueled unit tests. See: http://code.google.com/p/shunit2/
* The "Unix Toolbox" contains an astounding compendium of concise one-liners:
