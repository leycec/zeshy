zeshy is an unending work-in-progress. As such, the following remain undone:

* Add an ebuild. Since zeshy requires some means of detecting the current OS,
  desktop environment, and window manager, consider the following nonoptional
  runtime dependencies:
  DEPENDS="
      sys-apps/lsb-release
      X? ( || ( x11-apps/xprop x11-misc/wmctrl ) )
  "
* Examine "antigent", a Vundle-inspired zsh plugin framework.
* Examine "zshuery", a minimalist zsh framework alternative to oh-my-zsh
  leveraging the jQuery model:

* Add ctags support, which purportedly supports zsh out-of-the-box:

* Add a "ZESHY_IS_OPTIMIZING" configuration flag, which, when enabled, aliases
  all functions prefixed with die_*_{decimal,integer,string,list,map,variable}*() to ":" (i.e., noop()).
* Add shUnit2-fueled unit tests. See: http://code.google.com/p/shunit2/
* The "Unix Toolbox" contains an astounding compendium of concise one-liners:
